    "Twitter's [official API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs) is powerful is some ways, but fairly restrictive in the volume and pace of data collection. While social scientists are often interested in data from months or years ago, Twitter's [Standard Search API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/search/overview) only goes back seven days. The cost of [purchasing historical Twitter data](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tutorials/choosing-historical-api) is often out of reach of the average social scientist and even aquiring an API key has become increasingly difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, all of public Twitter is still available through its standard web interface. The Python library [twint](https://github.com/twintproject/twint) takes advantage of this so you can collect data from Twitter without using the API. While it's pretty powerful, one major limitation is that while it gives the count of times something has been liked or retweeted, it does not return who liked or retweeted it.\n",

    "I used a two-step process to install twint. First, I used conda to install the required packages that were available through the conda-forge. In my experience, conda packages always work, but the same isn't true for pip. In this specific case, I couldn't get one of the twint dependencies (cchardet) to build through pip, so I had to use conda. \n",

    "Before installation, it is helpful to make sure you have the most up-to-date version of conda. Unfortunately, one of the consequences of conda's careful package management is that it can be slow."
