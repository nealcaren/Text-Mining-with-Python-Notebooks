Wang has found himself trapped in an obstacle course regarding H-1B work visas for foreigners. His visa denied and his days in the United States numbered, Wang is looking for work outside the country. \u201cI still believe in the American dream,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I personally have to pursue it somewhere else.\u201d (AP Photo\/Ben Margot)<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/a><div class=\"Article\" data-key=\"article\"><p class=\"Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70\">NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Immigrants with specialized skills are being denied work visas or seeing applications get caught up in lengthy bureaucratic tangles under federal changes that some consider a contradiction to President Donald Trump\u2019s promise of a continued pathway to the U.S. for the most talented foreigners.<\/p><p class=\"Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70\">Getting what\u2019s known as an H-1B visa has never been a sure thing \u2014 the number issued annually is capped at 85,000 and applicants need to enter a lottery to even be considered. But some immigration attorneys, as well as those who hire such workers, say they\u2019ve seen unprecedented disruptions in the approval process since Trump took office in 2017.<\/p><div class=\"Component-dfp-0-2-74\"><div data-key=\"ad-placeholder\" id=\"div-gpt-ad_site_article_midarticle1\" class=\"DFPSlot Component-ad-0-2-39\"><\/div><\/div><p class=\"Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70\">\u201cYou see all these arguments that we want the best and the brightest coming here,\u201d said John Goslow, an immigration attorney in Ann Arbor, Michigan. \u201cYet we\u2019re seeing a full-frontal assault on just all aspects of immigration.\u201d<\/p><p class=\"Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70\">For American businesses, there is a bottom-line impact.<\/p><p class=\"Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70\">Link Wilson, an architect who co-founded a firm in Bloomington, Minnesota, said finding enough qualified workers within the U.S. has been a problem for years. That\u2019s due to a shortage of architects, but also because his firm needs people with experience developing senior housing. He said employers who turn to international applicants do so as a last resort, putting up with legal fees and ever-expanding visa approval times because they have no other choice.<\/p><p class=\"Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70\">\u201cWe\u2019re just at the point where there\u2019s no one else to hire,\u201d said Wilson, who hired an architect under an H-1B visa last year after enduring a long wait. He estimates his firm turned away about $1 million in projects in 2018 because it didn\u2019t have enough staff to handle them.<\/p><p class=\"Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70\">Three months after taking office, Trump issued his \u201cBuy American and Hire American\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/presidential-actions\/presidential-executive-order-buy-american-hire-american\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">executive order<\/a><!-- --> , directing Cabinet officials to suggest reforms to ensure that H-1B visas are awarded to the \u201cmost-skilled or highest-paid\u201d applicants to help promote the hiring of Americans for jobs that might otherwise go to immigrants.<\/p><p class=\"Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70\">Subsequent memos have allowed for greater discretion in denying applications without first requesting additional information from an applicant, tossed the deference given to people seeking to renew their H-1Bs, and raised concern that the government would revoke work permits for the spouses of H-1B holders. One order restricted companies\u2019 ability to use H-1B workers off-site at a customer\u2019s place of business, while another temporarily rescinded the option of paying for faster application processing.<\/p><div class=\"Component-dfp-0-2-74\"><div data-key=\"ad-placeholder\" id=\"div-gpt-ad_site_article_midarticle2\" class=\"DFPSlot Component-ad-0-2-39\"><\/div><\/div><p class=\"Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70\">Attorneys who handle these applications say one of the biggest shifts is an increase in \u201crequests for evidence,\u201d or RFEs, from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. An RFE can delay a visa for months or longer as applicants and employers are forced to submit additional documentation over things such as the applicability of a college degree to a prospective job or whether the wage being offered is appropriate. If the responses are unsatisfactory, a visa may be denied.<\/p><p class=\"Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70\">\u201cThey\u2019re just blocking the avenues so that employers will get frustrated and they won\u2019t employ foreign nationals,\u201d said Dakshini Sen, an immigration lawyer in Houston whose caseload is mostly H-1B applications. \u201cWe have to write and write and write and explain and explain and explain each and every point.\u201d<\/p><p class=\"Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70\">USCIS data released on Friday shows an increase in the number of completed H-1B applications receiving an RFE, from about 21 percent in the 2016 fiscal year to 38 percent last fiscal year. The number continued to rise in the first quarter of this fiscal year, to 60 percent.<\/p><p class=\"Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70\">A growing number of applications with such requests were ultimately denied, while the approval rate among all applicants has fallen. Approvals also dipped in two other visa programs for foreign workers, including one for individuals with extraordinary abilities in areas such as science, sports and the arts.<\/p><p class=\"Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70\">Jessica Collins, a spokeswoman for USCIS, linked the changes to the president\u2019s executive order, saying the goal was to reduce \u201cfrivolous\u201d petitions and that \u201cit is incumbent upon the petitioner, not the government\u201d to prove eligibility.<\/p><p class=\"Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70\">Some employers note traditional three-year renewable terms of H-1Bs have also been changing; one <a href=\"https:\/\/nfap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Doc-1-Complaint.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">lawsuit<\/a><!-- --> by an organization representing information technology companies claims some visas were valid for only a few days or had expired before they were even received.<\/p><p class=\"Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70\">Meantime, a vague <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reginfo.gov\/public\/do\/eAgendaViewRule?RIN=1615-AC13&amp;pubId=201810\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">entry<\/a><!-- --> published in the Federal Register last fall advised that the Department of Homeland Security would propose additional revisions to focus on attracting \u201cthe best and the brightest\u201d and to \u201censure employers pay appropriate wages\u201d to H-1B visa holders, which has raised alarms that the administration will move to narrow the definition of who qualifies.<\/p><p class=\"Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70\">Caught in the crosshairs of all this are workers like Leo Wang.<\/p><p class=\"Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70\">Wang, 32, spent six years after college in his native China learning all he could about data and analytics. He got into the University of Southern California, interned at a major venture capital firm and wasted no time after finishing his master\u2019s before starting on another degree. He couch-surfed, passed up an enticing foreign job offer and amassed educational debt all in pursuit of the dream that ultimately came true: A six-figure Silicon Valley job.<\/p><p class=\"Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70\">As long as it took Wang to achieve his goal, it disappeared in record time.<\/p><p class=\"Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70\">Wang was working at Seagate Technology under an immigration provision known as Optional Practical Training, which gives those on student visas permission to work. But that expired last year, and because his H-1B application was in flux, he was forced to take a leave from Seagate and withdraw from the master\u2019s program he was pursuing at Berkeley. He says he and his company dutifully responded to an RFE, compiling examples of his work at Seagate. But on Jan. 11, Wang got a final answer: He was denied an H-1B.<\/p><p class=\"Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70\">\u201cAll I wanted was to be able to see my American dream,\u201d he said.<\/p><p class=\"Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70\">Sandra Feist, an immigration attorney in Minneapolis, said talented foreigners discouraged by the visa process are beginning to look at opportunities in other countries, and she questions what that means for America\u2019s future, especially if top-tier researchers who could contribute to science and medicine are turned away.<\/p><p class=\"Component-root-0-2-78 Component-p-0-2-70\">One of her clients, a computer systems analyst from India with a master\u2019s degree from a U.S. college, filed his petition for an H-1B in April 2017 with 101 pages of documentation. He received an RFE, and a 176-page response was filed, with additional paperwork attempting to prove just how complicated the position was. He was denied. Feist filed a 282-page appeal, requesting that the file be reopened.

But some immigration attorneys, as well as those who hire such workers, say they've seen unprecedented disruptions in the approval process since Trump took office in 2017.\\u003c\/p>\\u003cdiv class=\\\"ad-placeholder\\\">\\u003c\/div>\\u003cp>\\\"You see all these arguments that we want the best and the brightest coming here,\\\" said John Goslow, an immigration attorney in Ann Arbor, Michigan. \\\"Yet we're seeing a full-frontal assault on just all aspects of immigration.\\\"\\u003c\/p>\\u003cp>For American businesses, there is a bottom-line impact.\\u003c\/p>\\u003cp>Link Wilson, an architect who co-founded a firm in Bloomington, Minnesota, said finding enough qualified workers within the U.S. has been a problem for years. That's due to a shortage of architects, but also because his firm needs people with experience developing senior housing. He said employers who turn to international applicants do so as a last resort, putting up with legal fees and ever-expanding visa approval times because they have no other choice.\\u003c\/p>\\u003cp>\\\"We're just at the point where there's no one else to hire,\\\" said Wilson, who hired an architect under an H-1B visa last year after enduring a long wait. He estimates his firm turned away about $1 million in projects in 2018 because it didn't have enough staff to handle them.\\u003c\/p>\\u003cp>Three months after taking office, Trump issued his \\\"Buy American and Hire American\\\" \\u003ca href=\\\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/presidential-actions\/presidential-executive-order-buy-american-hire-american\/\\\">executive order\\u003c\/a> , directing Cabinet officials to suggest reforms to ensure that H-1B visas are awarded to the \\\"most-skilled or highest-paid\\\" applicants to help promote the hiring of Americans for jobs that might otherwise go to immigrants.\\u003c\/p>\\u003cp>Subsequent memos have allowed for greater discretion in denying applications without first requesting additional information from an applicant, tossed the deference given to people seeking to renew their H-1Bs, and raised concern that the government would revoke work permits for the spouses of H-1B holders. One order restricted companies' ability to use H-1B workers off-site at a customer's place of business, while another temporarily rescinded the option of paying for faster application processing.\\u003c\/p>\\u003cdiv class=\\\"ad-placeholder\\\">\\u003c\/div>\\u003cp>Attorneys who handle these applications say one of the biggest shifts is an increase in \\\"requests for evidence,\\\" or RFEs, from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. An RFE can delay a visa for months or longer as applicants and employers are forced to submit additional documentation over things such as the applicability of a college degree to a prospective job or whether the wage being offered is appropriate. If the responses are unsatisfactory, a visa may be denied.\\u003c\/p>\\u003cp>\\\"They're just blocking the avenues so that employers will get frustrated and they won't employ foreign nationals,\\\" said Dakshini Sen, an immigration lawyer in Houston whose caseload is mostly H-1B applications. \\\"We have to write and write and write and explain and explain and explain each and every point.\\\"\\u003c\/p>\\u003cp>USCIS data released on Friday shows an increase in the number of completed H-1B applications receiving an RFE, from about 21 percent in the 2016 fiscal year to 38 percent last fiscal year. The number continued to rise in the first quarter of this fiscal year, to 60 percent.\\u003c\/p>\\u003cp>A growing number of applications with such requests were ultimately denied, while the approval rate among all applicants has fallen. Approvals also dipped in two other visa programs for foreign workers, including one for individuals with extraordinary abilities in areas such as science, sports and the arts.\\u003c\/p>\\u003cp>Jessica Collins, a spokeswoman for USCIS, linked the changes to the president's executive order, saying the goal was to reduce \\\"frivolous\\\" petitions and that \\\"it is incumbent upon the petitioner, not the government\\\" to prove eligibility.\\u003c\/p>\\u003cp>Some employers note traditional three-year renewable terms of H-1Bs have also been changing; one \\u003ca href=\\\"https:\/\/nfap.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Doc-1-Complaint.pdf\\\">lawsuit\\u003c\/a> by an organization representing information technology companies claims some visas were valid for only a few days or had expired before they were even received.\\u003c\/p>\\u003cp>Meantime, a vague \\u003ca href=\\\"https:\/\/www.reginfo.gov\/public\/do\/eAgendaViewRule?RIN=1615-AC13&amp;pubId=201810\\\">entry\\u003c\/a> published in the Federal Register last fall advised that the Department of Homeland Security would propose additional revisions to focus on attracting \\\"the best and the brightest\\\" and to \\\"ensure employers pay appropriate wages\\\" to H-1B visa holders, which has raised alarms that the administration will move to narrow the definition of who qualifies.\\u003c\/p>\\u003cp>Caught in the crosshairs of all this are workers like Leo Wang.\\u003c\/p>\\u003cp>Wang, 32, spent six years after college in his native China learning all he could about data and analytics. He got into the University of Southern California, interned at a major venture capital firm and wasted no time after finishing his master's before starting on another degree. He couch-surfed, passed up an enticing foreign job offer and amassed educational debt all in pursuit of the dream that ultimately came true: A six-figure Silicon Valley job.\\u003c\/p>\\u003cp>As long as it took Wang to achieve his goal, it disappeared in record time.\\u003c\/p>\\u003cp>Wang was working at Seagate Technology under an immigration provision known as Optional Practical Training, which gives those on student visas permission to work. But that expired last year, and because his H-1B application was in flux, he was forced to take a leave from Seagate and withdraw from the master's program he was pursuing at Berkeley. He says he and his company dutifully responded to an RFE, compiling examples of his work at Seagate. But on Jan. 11, Wang got a final answer: He was denied an H-1B.\\u003c\/p>\\u003cp>\\\"All I wanted was to be able to see my American dream,\\\" he said.\\u003c\/p>\\u003cp>Sandra Feist, an immigration attorney in Minneapolis, said talented foreigners discouraged by the visa process are beginning to look at opportunities in other countries, and she questions what that means for America's future, especially if top-tier researchers who could contribute to science and medicine are turned away.\\u003c\/p>\\u003cp>One of her clients, a computer systems analyst from India with a master's degree from a U.S. college, filed his petition for an H-1B in April 2017 with 101 pages of documentation. He received an RFE, and a 176-page response was filed, with additional paperwork attempting to prove just how complicated the position was. He was denied. Feist filed a 282-page appeal, requesting that the file be reopened.

But some immigration attorneys, as well as those who hire such workers, say they\u2019ve seen unprecedented disruptions in the approval process since Trump took office in 2017.\n\n\u201cYou see all these arguments that we want the best and the brightest coming here,\u201d said John Goslow, an immigration attorney in Ann Arbor, Michigan. \u201cYet we\u2019re seeing a full-frontal assault on just all aspects of immigration.\u201d\n\nFor American businesses, there is a bottom-line impact.\n\nLink Wilson, an architect who co-founded a firm in Bloomington, Minnesota, said finding enough qualified workers within the U.S. has been a problem for years. That\u2019s due to a shortage of architects, but also because his firm needs people with experience developing senior housing. He said employers who turn to international applicants do so as a last resort, putting up with legal fees and ever-expanding visa approval times because they have no other choice.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just at the point where there\u2019s no one else to hire,\u201d said Wilson, who hired an architect under an H-1B visa last year after enduring a long wait. He estimates his firm turned away about $1 million in projects in 2018 because it didn\u2019t have enough staff to handle them.\n\nThree months after taking office, Trump issued his \u201cBuy American and Hire American\u201d executive order , directing Cabinet officials to suggest reforms to ensure that H-1B visas are awarded to the \u201cmost-skilled or highest-paid\u201d applicants to help promote the hiring of Americans for jobs that might otherwise go to immigrants.\n\nSubsequent memos have allowed for greater discretion in denying applications without first requesting additional information from an applicant, tossed the deference given to people seeking to renew their H-1Bs, and raised concern that the government would revoke work permits for the spouses of H-1B holders. One order restricted companies\u2019 ability to use H-1B workers off-site at a customer\u2019s place of business, while another temporarily rescinded the option of paying for faster application processing.\n\nAttorneys who handle these applications say one of the biggest shifts is an increase in \u201crequests for evidence,\u201d or RFEs, from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. An RFE can delay a visa for months or longer as applicants and employers are forced to submit additional documentation over things such as the applicability of a college degree to a prospective job or whether the wage being offered is appropriate. If the responses are unsatisfactory, a visa may be denied.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just blocking the avenues so that employers will get frustrated and they won\u2019t employ foreign nationals,\u201d said Dakshini Sen, an immigration lawyer in Houston whose caseload is mostly H-1B applications. \u201cWe have to write and write and write and explain and explain and explain each and every point.\u201d\n\nUSCIS data released on Friday shows an increase in the number of completed H-1B applications receiving an RFE, from about 21 percent in the 2016 fiscal year to 38 percent last fiscal year. The number continued to rise in the first quarter of this fiscal year, to 60 percent.\n\nA growing number of applications with such requests were ultimately denied, while the approval rate among all applicants has fallen. Approvals also dipped in two other visa programs for foreign workers, including one for individuals with extraordinary abilities in areas such as science, sports and the arts.\n\nJessica Collins, a spokeswoman for USCIS, linked the changes to the president\u2019s executive order, saying the goal was to reduce \u201cfrivolous\u201d petitions and that \u201cit is incumbent upon the petitioner, not the government\u201d to prove eligibility.\n\nSome employers note traditional three-year renewable terms of H-1Bs have also been changing; one lawsuit by an organization representing information technology companies claims some visas were valid for only a few days or had expired before they were even received.\n\nMeantime, a vague entry published in the Federal Register last fall advised that the Department of Homeland Security would propose additional revisions to focus on attracting \u201cthe best and the brightest\u201d and to \u201censure employers pay appropriate wages\u201d to H-1B visa holders, which has raised alarms that the administration will move to narrow the definition of who qualifies.\n\nCaught in the crosshairs of all this are workers like Leo Wang.\n\nWang, 32, spent six years after college in his native China learning all he could about data and analytics. He got into the University of Southern California, interned at a major venture capital firm and wasted no time after finishing his master\u2019s before starting on another degree. He couch-surfed, passed up an enticing foreign job offer and amassed educational debt all in pursuit of the dream that ultimately came true: A six-figure Silicon Valley job.\n\nAs long as it took Wang to achieve his goal, it disappeared in record time.\n\nWang was working at Seagate Technology under an immigration provision known as Optional Practical Training, which gives those on student visas permission to work. But that expired last year, and because his H-1B application was in flux, he was forced to take a leave from Seagate and withdraw from the master\u2019s program he was pursuing at Berkeley. He says he and his company dutifully responded to an RFE, compiling examples of his work at Seagate. But on Jan. 11, Wang got a final answer: He was denied an H-1B.\n\n\u201cAll I wanted was to be able to see my American dream,\u201d he said.\n\nSandra Feist, an immigration attorney in Minneapolis, said talented foreigners discouraged by the visa process are beginning to look at opportunities in other countries, and she questions what that means for America\u2019s future, especially if top-tier researchers who could contribute to science and medicine are turned away.\n\nOne of her clients, a computer systems analyst from India with a master\u2019s degree from a U.S. college, filed his petition for an H-1B in April 2017 with 101 pages of documentation. He received an RFE, and a 176-page response was filed, with additional paperwork attempting to prove just how complicated the position was. He was denied. Feist filed a 282-page appeal, requesting that the file be reopened. Though the appeal was approved, there was a second RFE, which Feist said raises the same issues she already responded to.\n\nWith a U.S. work visa unlikely, that client is applying for permanent residency in Canada with his wife and U.S. citizen child.\n\nCEOs for companies including Apple, Ford and Coca-Cola penned a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in August, saying immigration policy changes were undermining economic growth. \u201cAt a time when the number of job vacancies are reaching historic highs due to labor shortages,\u201d they said, \u201cnow is not the time to restrict access to talent.\u201d\n\nA provision for immigration based on skills, education and employer needs dates back to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, and the visa now known as the H-1B has until recently enjoyed wide support among politicians on both the left and the right. A Pew Research Center survey last year found broad approval for high-skilled immigrants among the public, as well, with support at 83 percent among Democrats polled and 73 percent of Republicans.\n\nTrump has vacillated on the issue. During a March 2016 presidential debate, then-candidate Trump was asked about his opposition to visas for skilled workers, to which he said \u201cI\u2019m changing\u201d and that he saw such policies as a way to keep top international students in the U.S. \u201cWe absolutely have to be able to keep the brain power in this country,\u201d he said.\n\nHis campaign followed that with a statement saying: \u201cThe H-1B program is neither high-skilled nor immigration: these are temporary foreign workers, imported from abroad, for the explicit purpose of substituting for American workers at lower pay.\u201d\n\nLast month, Trump again reverted to a more conciliatory note, tweeting that H1-B holders \u201ccan rest assured that changes are soon coming which will bring both simplicity and certainty to your stay, including a potential path to citizenship.\u201d\n\nBack in China now, Wang isn\u2019t sure what to make of Trump\u2019s words. He\u2019s talked to a friend from Seagate, now at a Swedish firm, about openings there, and a former boss in Singapore has some prospects for him as well.\n\n\u201cI still believe in the American dream,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I personally have to pursue it somewhere else.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSedensky can be reached at msedensky@ap.org and https:\/\/twitter.com\/sedensky","title":"Worker visas in doubt as Trump immigration crackdown widens","webUrl":"https:\/\/apnews.com\/af878855969c4b48bc8b083b91c67018"}]
