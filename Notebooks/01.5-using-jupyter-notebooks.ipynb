GitHub renders non-interactive versions of notebook files, so they can be previewed within a repo.

If you're using notebooks to document your workflow, you might choose to add the new code cell to an existing notebook, rather than downloading it as a separate, stand-alone notebook. Jupyter notebooks can be particularly helpful for documenting project workflows when you're working with collaborators who may only be involved for a short period of time (such as summer undergraduate interns). With short-term collaborators, it's important to help them understand and start using the project's workflows without a lot of start-up time, and Jupyter notebooks can lay out these workflows step-by-step, explain where and how files are stored, and provide pointers to external tutorials and training materials to help collaborators who are less familiar with the project's technical underpinnings get started. \n",

While journals and presses may not accept Jupyter notebooks as a submission format, you could develop a notebook \"version\" of your paper that includes the full text (as Markdown cells), with code cells integrated into the flow of the scholarly narrative as an immediately accessable illustration of the analysis you're describing. You could also include the code cells that make up the data preparation workflows as an appendix, either in the same notebook, or in a separate one. Integrating the code with the text of a scholarly article makes it far more likely that readers will actually engage with the code, since they can simply run it within the same notebook where they're reading the argument. Some scholars, particularly in Europe, also post their notebooks to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), an archive for research regardless of the country of origin, funder, or discipline. Zenodo supports data sets up to 50 GB (vs. the 100 MB file size limit on Github), and provides DOIs for uploaded material, including notebooks. Some scholars combine archiving on Zenodo for sustainability with publishing on GitHub for findability, by including the Zenodo DOI as part of the readme.md file in the GitHub repository that includes the notebooks. As an example, Giovanni Colavizza and Matteo Romanello's [\"Applied Data Analytics\" workshop notebook for DHOxSS 2019](https://github.com/mromanello/ADA-DHOxSS2019) is published on GitHub but includes a Zenodo DOI."
