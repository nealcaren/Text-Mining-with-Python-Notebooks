I live at home with my mother, stepfather, younger brother and younger sister.\\n\\nThe hours my team and I play are between 6pm and 12am every night, although not for 6 hours continuously; it may be 9pm till 12am, or 6pm till 10pm, etc. and obviously I'm talking during those hours. Whenever my mother tells me they're going to bed though, I always do my best to keep it down and get offline as soon as possible. Sometimes I'll be in an important game though, so it takes me a little while before I stop talking.\\n\\nOver the past few weeks or so, my console has started booting me offline without fail between the hours of 11pm and 12am. This is a huge issue because I'll be booted during a big game fairly often and I'll be unable to connect again until the next day. It also means it's a huge burden on my teammates as we often lose out on an hour of practice. It never really occurred to me that my stepfather could've put parental controls on (I'm 18).\\n\\nThen, last night, at the same time, my PC's internet went off too. It's usually just my console, so I was pretty confused. Then my browser came up with a window saying 'This system is being blocked from accessing the internet.', so I immediately knew what was up. I went on my phone, accessed the browser page from my phone and tried to disable it that way. I couldn't guess the password though, so I went to the 'password override' option which involves holding a button physically on the router, putting in the serial number, wireless key and a new password. I waited until everyone had gone to bed, then went downstairs and did that. After that I accessed the parental controls, and there was a block for both my Xbox and my PC from 23:00 to 07:00. I deleted both of them, went back upstairs and continued on my PC.\\n\\nSo now my stepfather doesn't know the new password (although he could do the same override I did if he figures out how) and I don't get booted offline anymore.

I had no clue someone could snore this loud and not wake his or her self up until now. He sounds like a fucking animal sometimes. He tops it off by moaning in his sleep after the loudest snores. You can hear it throughout my entire suite, even with doors clothes. I haven\\'t approached him about it, but I know he knows about it. A friend of his spent the night in our room a few weekends ago, and one of the first things she said was \"have you told him about your snoring??\" He kind of brushed it off and quickly changed the subject. So he knows. He has to know. It\\'s too loud not to know. This is fine, you can\\'t help snoring sometimes. That being said, he sleeps *12 fucking hours a day*. On Mondays like today he sleeps for 8 hours then naps for 4 hours during the day. Nothing like coming to your dorm from a long day of class to your jackhammer going berzerk in the bed next to you. I\\'m not to pleased. Why does he sleep so much? It connects to my next point...\\n\\n* He\\'s a lazy fuck. He\\'s very fat, and makes no attempt to change that. He has the attitude that everyone is perfect just the way they are, and no one should change. I think it\\'s because it would be hard for him to change for the better. He eats insane amounts of food sometimes. In addition to this, he doesn\\'t do anything recreational. All I see him do with his time is sleep, go to class (which is fantastic), lay on his bed with his laptop, and sit in the lounge of my dorm. He doesn\\'t help with room keep up at all. Most of these qualities seem pretty innocuous, but let me get to my last quality..\\n* He is an absolute immature cretin on social media. His stream of conscience reminds me of my 13 year old sister. He tweets about Disney, vodka, complaining, and preaching. Recently the city my college is located in (Raleigh) had a snowstorm that included a traffic emergency. Everything was on lockdown. That didn\\'t stop him from ordering his second pizza of the day, making the delivery guy walk to give it to him and brag about it on twitter. Just tonight, he tweeted that a \"stupid bitch was facetiming on the top of her lungs in the study lounge like a valley girl, girl please shut up with your iphone 3\". I knew the girl facetiming, so this kinda got under my skin. She wasn\\'t even in the study lounge!. I got to talking with all my friends about it.\\n\\nTonight though, I thought about something. I am talking about him a lot. I mean, he gives me a lot to talk about. However, I feel like I may be just as bad as he is, talking about him and the things he does with my friends and floormates behind his back. So, am I the asshole?

At some point our friendship died...\\n\\nSeveral months later, xmas 2012, we invited our families and needed 8 wine glasses. But we had just 7 .. because she had destroyed one. I was so angry because this made me remember her and what she did. So I sent her a very insulting SMS.

I sent another VERY insulting SMS.\\n\\nNow she sued me and won. I have to pay a more than 900$ penalty.\\n\\nShe\\'s got borderline, which of course explains EVERYTHING she\\'s done.

To do this, we typically arranged something via text message, which worked totally fine. \\n\\n  Anyway, the last time I saw her was in November, and admittedly she was, at the time anyway, busy with a number of commitments and problems that had come up. However, I have my own commitments including a job and voluntary events, and she was totally aware of this, as well as being aware that I was also similarly going through a number of issues of my own. It cannot have been an issue of time as she had more free time than I do and a lot more money than me too, despite being on welfare benefits and getting things like a house (something I would so desperately love) pretty much given to her. Then she meets me and whines about how terrible the house is or how she's bored sitting in the house all day, knowing fine and well I've got to work for the little money I earn. \\n\\n Anyway, we agreed in November that we'd try and meet in December, just before Christmas. When this didn't happen, I hoped that we could at least have a coffee before the New Year came round and I would be busy at work. In both cases it was always some excuse or another, and eventually New Year came without me hearing a single word from her. \\n\\n  So come the middle of January I rang her and asked her what was happening. She promised me **faithfully** that in two weeks time (the start of Febuary) she'd meet me. This, like the other previous times, she told me she couldn't meet me and it would be two weeks before she could meet me. I told her that she should ring me in a week and let me know what was happening, as I'd had some holidays booked from work and so was freer than usual to meet. \\n   \\n  I made a point of waiting until last week to give her some space, but when the usual promise of meeting in two week's time got trotted out, I gave her an ultimatum via text. I'll bulletpoint the texts in paraphrased fashion:\\n\\n* **Text 1**: Look, all I'm asking for is a date. I've got my work and I'm also bored of getting messed around, bearing in mind I'm being promised you'll meet me. \\n\\n*Her response: Yeah well I've got problems in my life and all I'm trying to do is be a good friend, and you're making demands of me and being horrible to me.*\\n\\n**Text 2**: Well yeah, I've got problems too. Also, you did stuff wrong too, and you seem more interested in yourself than anyone, despite you calling me a friend**\\n\\n*Her response: Well this is all your fault, you seem to think your whole life is dependent on me. Just go and do whatever you want, I don't care.*\\n\\n**Text 3 (final text)**: Surprise, surprise, it's my fault. Act like an adult, not a kid, and actually realise that you're not the centre of my life, and that you're acting like it's the end of the world because I actually want to know what's happening in my life, bearing in mind you're expecting me to spend good money on petrol and food. \\n\\n  This prompted a long, rambling phonecall (which I ignored for the most part) about how she 'wasn't friends with me any more' and how she hated me.

The friendship ended with lots of (metaphorical) bloodshed, though in my defense, I was a high school freshman and afraid of having a direct confrontation. \\n\\nBasically, me and this chick M had been total best friends for about a year after I had moved to a new school. She was the first friend I made and being the insecure eighth-grader I had been I latched onto her like a cross between a leech and a member of a cult dedicated to her worship. \\n\\nIn the beginning, at least, she had been pretty much an ordinary best friend. She liked to draw, when we hung out around the school afterschool doing homework, she\\'d usually end up doodling something. She would always make a big game out of me not being able to see it until it\\'s done (which was basically never since she\\'s way too lazy to finish drawings), so I made a big game out of finding ways to dramatically steal it. It was like an inside joke between us.\\n\\nOur friendship was fine, until she slowly became obsessed with the idea of internet fame (mostly through her drawings or possibly her modeling). She made a bunch of internet friends through tumblr and would constantly be tweeting them and talking about them. She tried to make an effort to have me get to know them, though it felt more like showing her internet friends her irl groupies than trying to include me in her new group of friends.\\n\\nWe would still hang out, but she started expecting me to be constantly showering her with praise (which I had happily done without being asked in the past), but in return she would endlessly belittle me. \\n\\nHere\\'s a conversation that I still vividly remember. The context is she was compiling info on a bunch of our friends in order to draw fanart of us in a Victoria\\'s Secret alternate universe.\\n\\nM: Wow, your waist is (i don\\'t remember the number) centimeters, that\\'s twice as much as mine!\\n\\nme: Yeah, well my bigger boobs came at a price. (she\\'s flat as a board and skinny as a toothpick)\\n\\nM: Yeah, well Behati only has 34B, so maybe yours are too big. Oh that reminds me in the VSAU, you obviously can\\'t be a model. I think you\\'d make a good casting director though.\\n\\nIn this Victoria\\'s Secret fantasy of hers she was/is dating Adam Levine and is a Victoria\\'s Secret Angel. As a direct result of her pipe dream relationship with Adam, she banned me from being a fan of Adam and said that I could like James Valentine, the guitarist from the same band. She also \"claimed\" Sherlock from BBC Sherlock and several other guys that she considered hot. \\n\\nBasically, the rest of the group of friends and I were getting tired of her shit. We all were starting to realize what a bitch she was being a lot of the time and some of us (me being the strongest advocate) wanted to just cut ties. I was definitely the person that was closest to her, so they all pretty much accepted that I knew her best. But none of us wanted to have to confront her.\\n\\nWhat ended up happening is that she realized that I was mad at her because I had been talking to her much less. Her first instinct was to get closer with the others, but because of the horror stories I told them they didn\\'t want to be the next person she took out her insecurities on. She then started ignoring us back. The whole while this was going on we all still hanging out like normal in school, though not outside of school.\\n\\nAfter about a week of ignoring us she just stopped sitting with us. We were all grateful and went back to normal really quickly, even laughing at how the only people that came to her birthday party other than her family was her dad\\'s employee\\'s daughter.\\n\\nMeanwhile, she was asking mutual friends what she had done wrong and why we\\'d been mad at her in the first place. She genuinely had no idea what she had done wrong.

I just heard this community exists and I thought it would be the perfect place to talk about this. I posted the whole story in /r/pettyrevenge and got a really mixed bag of responses, so I\\'m curious what people here think.\\n\\nBasically, I was at a John Mayer concert, in a pretty good seat but off to the side (not in the pit, which is relevant). When JM came out, he was playing a really rockin\\' tune, so I stood up and started jamming out. I would say ~90% of the people in the arena were standing for this, but my section was a disproportionately sitting one. I was really the only one in the immediate area standing. I would stand and sit intermittently as the songs went on based on the dance-factor of the song and how much I liked it.\\n\\nAt one point while I was standing up, two women about four rows behind me started throwing popcorn at me and yelling at me to sit down. I got really embarrassed and sat, but after a few minutes I was upset with how they had handled it, so a few songs later, I stood back up (with the help of my girlfriend and a few other people around us who had scene the exchange). By this point a few other isolated people/couples had done the same for a couple songs at a time. My \"petty revenge\" was subtly encouraging people around me to stand up, helping create a majority so that a.) it would be fine for me to stand and b.) the women would have a harder time telling 20 people to sit down.\\n\\nTo be fair, I was a lot meaner in the telling in /r/pettyrevenge, so [here is the link](http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1y9dny/standing_up_for_my_right_to_stand_up/) if you\\'d like to read it and the ensuing comments. I just kind of assumed people would be on my side, as you can tell by my whiny edit at the top. \\n\\nAm I the asshole? I want to believe I\\'m not, mostly because I think throwing popcorn at someone is incredibly rude, at which point I didn\\'t care, and I would have responded much more sympathetically to a more gentle approach. Other people felt that I was not entitled to any courtesies because I started the asshole train by standing in the first place, and honestly I understand that too, which is why I sat down in the first place. I didn\\'t want to be rude and block views. But I also believed that I wasn\\'t in the wrong to stand given the nature of the act--he\\'s got some jams and is very encouraging of light dancing. Still, for people that just wanted to sit down and enjoy the show, I was definitely hurting the experience. Please let me know what you think.\\n\\n**tl;dr** Stood up at a concert, got popcorn\\'d, stood back up later, encouraging others to do the same.', 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'Standing up at a John Mayer concert', 'url': 'http://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1z313z/standing_up_at_a_john_mayer_concert/'}, {'author': 'lukeyflukey', 'author_created_utc': 1357702956, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'author_fullname': 't2_a5n2q', 'created_utc': 1393511599, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1z35di/aita_for_blowing_a_friend_off/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '1z35di', 'is_self': True, 'link_flair_css_class': 'not', 'link_flair_text': 'not the asshole', 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 7, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1z35di/aita_for_blowing_a_friend_off/', 'retrieved_on': 1441893445, 'score': 0, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': \"Just for a bit of context, this guy and I hang out literally 2-4 times a week usually.

I have friends who're also on twitter and follow the same people as I do. Next saturday there would be a twitter meetup, in a student village and the plan was to go out. I planned to go with that (girl) friend of mine and asked to borrow the car from my parents since I didn't feel like hanging out all night with these people. (They have met lots of time and 80% of their friends are actually from twitter).\\n\\nThe monday of that week, I went to TED and thanks to Foursquare I discovered that there were some 'tweeps' over there there too, I talked to them for 5 minutes and he told me to come to the meeting.\\n\\nLater that week, another girl (let's call her Crazy Bitch or CB) had some free tickets to the avant-première of Thor 2 in a movieplex nearby, I replied and went over there to meet her and watch the movie. It was fun and asked if she came to the meetup aswell. She did and I told her she could come along with us since I have 4 places in the car and appearantly we live nearby. We ran into each other at school, even tough I had never seen her there before.\\nFriday evening was halloween night, so I was still tired saturday.\\n\\nThat saturday it was the infamous meetup. A mutual friend of me and my friend wanted to go out, since we were going to that meeting we told him he could join us, even tough he's not active on Twitter. CP let us know she and a friend were coming over soon, what? a friend? who invited her? You can't assume I have enough place to accomodate everyone. Because of that our mutual friend couldn't join, but that was no big deal.\\nI had to be home at 2 AM and felt like it would be late enough already around these people. So we're drinking and talking at different bars. Around quarter over 1 I tell CB that we're about to leave since we have to get the car and it's still a half hour drive. She tells us she's going to greet everyone. After 30 minutes waiting outside and talking to others, we get in to look for her. She was still talking and didn't feel pressured at all. We told everyone goodbye within 2 minutes and left.\\n\\nWhile walking to the car, CB's friend really had to pee. Are you fucking kidding me? We've been at bars ALL NIGHT! She's theatening to wet the car if she can't find a toilet. OMG, I'm mad and get the car meanwhile, while complaining to my friend. We leave the village at 2 AM.\\n\\nAs I'm on the highway and realize it's still 20 minutes till my friends home I ask them if it's fine to drop them there aswell, they can now call a taxi if they like. Withing the captial regeon, Taxi's are quite cheap. But the capital is also concidered dangerous, especially if you live in another city.. Which is totally exaggerated, especailly at 3 AM at the first exit of the highway. As we arrive the taxi's already waiting, and called to ask where they are. The friend asks if I needed money for the petrol. My parents pay it, so I don't mind, but since I was outraged I asked €10. All good I think and drive home, 10 minutes later I get in bed, 1 hour later than expected. (Besides, €10 is the student wage for one hour work, which is a perfect compensation. Also, the car is around €50k, devided by 200k km, multiplied by the traveled distance is also €10, so it's still justifiable)\\n\\nSo the next day there was a huge discussion on Twitter, I didn't notice until someone asked me about it in a Direct Message. I had no idea what this was all about and decided to ask CB, to my astonishment she blocked me. What? Well appearantly I dropped 2 young girls in the middle of the capital, a VERY dangerous city and they were unsafe.

I had a tiny budget, so I was getting around by hitch hiking and sleeping in my tent most nights. One afternoon I was picked up by a friendly older Kiwi. It turned out his business is consulting for struggling hostels, so he very frequently meets travelers like me and picks up hitch hikers. He has traveled the country dozens of times. On the way to my destination he went out of his way to take me to some cool thermal pools and pretty sights. It was great, because I likely would have just passed straight by them if anybody else had picked me up. \\n\\nHe was going on a speaking tour over the next week. Shortly before arriving at my destination he said, \"It\\'s too bad your not going to this other way with me next instead. I could show you this spot and that. And I could get you free accomodation in these towns.\" Since he had been so friendly, and because I wanted to be open to fun new experiences and people, I decided spur of the moment to change my plan and keep traveling with him instead. \\n\\nI stay in his hotel room with him that night. He got us both dinner with the food budget he had from his employer. He then suggested we buy some alcohol, and asks if I don\\'t mind paying since he got dinner. I had planned on giving up drinking at this point in my trip to save money, but I was happy to since he was being so nice and helpful to me. I bought a couple bottles of wine that got polished off pretty fast. And he ended up sharing a lot of whiskey that he had brought, so he was definitely giving back more than he was asking. We probably stayed up till 2 in the morning drinking, and had some great conversation.\\n\\nThe next day we move on to the next city, and basically repeat the night before. I buy a couple bottles of wine, and he very insistently makes me take a couple whiskey shots. At this point his personality is really starting to grate on me, but I figure it would be rude to leave early when he is expecting me to keep traveling with him for a couple more days.\\n\\nDay 3, while we\\'re driving he straight up calls me out for not being appreciative enough of him. In particular, he said that I should be making more of an effort to buy food or drinks. He was mad at me that he had to ask me to buy the wine, and that I wasn\\'t pushing to do so myself. His reasoning is that I should be spending whatever money I am saving by not staying in a hostel on things that we can enjoy. He frequently hosts couch surfers, and says that is standard practice when somebody provides you with a place to stay. But I actually spent more money traveling with him than I would have without. And it seemed unfair to expect we should each contribute equally, because I had almost no money and he had kept bragging about how much money he was making from each of his speaking engagements. This pretty much spelled the end of traveling together for me, and I hitched another ride while he was in one of his speaking engagements. He never responded to my message when I told him what I was doing. \\n\\nEver since I\\'ve been worrying about this general situation. I\\'m very stingy with what I allow myself to buy. So I\\'m also not usually buying stuff that I share with other people. But when other people offer to share with me, I will often take it. I think I\\'m kind of a free loader.

Yes, I totally agree.\\n\\n&gt;&gt;Victim-blaming has no place in an institution as influential as school.\\n\\n&gt;Knowingly letting your nine year-old wear cartoon backpacks that are almost guaranteed to make other kids shit on him is pretty asinine.\\n\\nI realized at this point that I may have come across as overbearing, so replied trying to clear it up: \\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt;That\\'s a backward logic that should have no place in school.\\n\\n&gt;&gt;When have public schools ever anything operate on anything but backwards logic?\\n\\n&gt;Many times? Institutions which were influenced by feminist and womens rights groups dared to incorporate into their policy that women should be allowed to wear typically male clothing. \\n\\n&gt;&gt;A few decades ago women were thoroughly shamed for wearing pants\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, the my little pony backpack is total analogous to women not being allowed to wear pants.*Totally.*\\n\\n&gt;The logic used in both scenarios is most definitely comparable. I am by no means trying to compare the severity of both situations. \\n\\n\\n\\n&gt;&gt;f you were alive then and a woman being bullied was told to stop wearing pants, would you sympathize with the school\\'s actions? \\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt;You should probably tell me I\\'d tell blacks to get to the back of the bus too, drama queen.\\n\\n&gt;..Woah there, did I hit a bone with you? Never did I accuse you personally of anything, and if you read that as so, I am telling you now that I wrote that comment without any emotion directed toward you. If you have a problem with my comment, direct it to my words and not me personally. If you wish to continue to make this personal, then I have no interest in this conversation. \\n\\n&gt;&gt;It\\'s a horrible idea and should be treated as such.\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Letting your son wear a My Little Pony backpack to school? Yes, I totally agree.\\n\\n&gt;In many schools, no bullying would result from this. Sometimes wearing \"goth\" clothing and makeup can get both girls and boys bullied in school, but that shouldn\\'t force a parent to absolutely prohibit their children from wearing a certain kind of look. \\n\\n&gt;&gt;Victim-blaming has no place in an institution as influential as school.\\n\\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Knowingly letting your nine year-old wear cartoon backpacks that are almost guaranteed to make other kids shit on him is pretty asinine.\\n\\n&gt;As I said, there are places where no bullying would occur as a result of this. In any case, even if you do desire to put slight blame and criticism onto the mother, that is an entirely different subject. The school as a governmental entity should direct the punishing to the perpetrators. If a girl wearing a miniskirt is raped by a classmate, the classmate should be punished and not the girl. As I said, I am not comparing the severity of these situations, but the reality is that the logic used to arrive to both conclusions is similar, and both are examples of victim-blaming. We don\\'t live in a society where people are punished for increasing their chances of being a victim, and a school which runs because of the government should follow similar principles of righteousness. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis whole exchange went on and on until it became more personal.

I\\'ll admit I wasn\\'t 100% attentive at this moment, but I also think the Audi was going a bit too fast for being in a parking lot. There was no stop sign where I was, it was a situation where I was supposed to yield. I judged that the car was far enough away that I had time to make the turn, so I did. The Audi got really close to my car while I turned and had to stop. I knew I fucked up--I was pretty embarrassed so I didn\\'t look to see the driver\\'s face, but I could tell out of the corner of my eye that he wasn\\'t happy. I thought \"Oh well, at least it\\'s over. What\\'s the worst that could happen, he follows me?\" (Which I never thought would actually happen. When this happened, he was driving in the opposite direction from where I was headed. This means he actually made an effort to stop and turn around.)\\n\\nFast forward about five minutes. I parked at the grocery store. I was grabbing my stuff to get out of the car, and I heard a knock on the window. I was about to get out anyway, so I opened the door. It was someone I didn\\'t recognize. He starts to say, \"Next time, learn how to drive!\"\\n\\nI immediately realized who it was, and I said, \"You followed me here...?!\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, you almost did some serious damage to my car.

I\\'ll admit I wasn\\'t paying full attention. I\\'m really sorry. I don\\'t know what else to say.\"\\n\\nAt this point, I was really freaked out. I figured if this guy followed me, he was at least a little crazy...but after that he pretty much accepted my apology and went on his way. I feel like I should mention that while he got out of his car to talk to me, he left his car parked in the middle of the parking lot. The incident had me pretty shook up for the rest of the day.

Bonnie and I have been, as the story starts out, romantically involved for less than 5 months.\\n\\nI have the ability and tools to do certain jobs that Annie and Bonnie need done. Annie wants to compensate me (which I tried to dissuade her from doing, but she insisted) but Annie doesn't have the cash she thinks the work is worth. Instead, at Bonnie’s suggestion, Annie offers to trade a vehicle worth roughly what the jobs are worth. This vehicle used to belong to her deceased son (Bonnie’s brother). It had also at that time sat idle for nearly 4 years. Because I like the vehicle and have the ability to bring it back to operating order, plus want to keep Annie happy, I accept the offer.\\n\\nAfterward, Annie tells me that she preferred that the vehicle not go to Bonnie after I suggested that she drive it when she wanted (Annie said she was concerned about safety, as it’s a bit top-heavy, not a hardtop, and has nothing but a basic seatbelt). I then find that Bonnie has been really wanting the vehicle anyway, even though she knew of her mother’s objections. At this point I begin to suspect that Bonnie’s running a scheme to get the vehicle despite her mother’s wishes, but since it’s just a suspicion and otherwise we’re having a great relationship, I let it go.\\n\\nI complete just about everything that Bonnie needed, plus some other things that come up incidentally. In the meantime, I’ve spent a good bit of money and time getting the vehicle back into operating order and making a few improvements. The jobs I need to do for Annie require that one or both of them be present or allow me access to out-of-town property. I complete a couple of days’ worth and then something weird happens. Every opportunity that I have to work for Annie, Bonnie has convinced her to take a daytrip, or some other distraction, or gives me conflicting information regarding the arrangements that keeps me from being able to complete the work. Bonnie goes quiet when I ask about this phenomenon, and our relationship falters.\\n\\nDespite what I feel are one-sided efforts on my part to discuss these and other issues, our relationship starts to cool at the 10-11 month mark. I make the split, finally and at the time amicably, after 14 months, with Bonnie bemoaning our “lack of communication” and telling me that only she knows what her mother REALLY wants/needs, and states that my understanding of Annie’s clear language is severely flawed. Due to this and other factors, some of the jobs that Annie needed done did not get done. I don’t feel comfortable contacting Annie directly and risking coming between her and her daughter (they’re basically the only family each of them have left in the local area).\\n\\nA couple of months after we split, Bonnie contacts me on Facebook, requesting that I give the vehicle to her. Due to the abusive nature of her language I do not reply, but instead block her on Facebook and from calling or texting me. I have not blocked any communication from Annie, however, but have yet to hear anything at all from her. If they can maintain a good relationship by both hating me, I’m OK with that, even though I still regard Annie very highly.\\n\\nI do not live/work/travel through the areas they are in, so it’s not likely that they will see the vehicle. Besides, I have altered it’s appearance in various ways, and I don’t feel that they would immediately recognize it if they did happen to see it. Just to throw one more factor in, it currently needs a major repair to the transmission that, according to mechanics much better than I, is likely due to the long time sitting idle.\\n\\nAm I the asshole?\\n\\n**TL/DR; I've got my ex-GF's dead brother's car that her mother gave to me, and the ex wants me to give it to her.**\", 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AItA: The title, registration, and insurance are in my name', 'url': 'http://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/211phs/aita_the_title_registration_and_insurance_are_in/'}, {'author': 'IAmElizabethGould', 'author_created_utc': 1388098480, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'author_fullname': 't2_eiwf6', 'created_utc': 1395692316, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/219ccq/aita_for_resenting_my_cousins_new_job/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '219ccq', 'is_self': True, 'link_flair_css_class': 'not', 'link_flair_text': 'not the asshole', 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 27, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/219ccq/aita_for_resenting_my_cousins_new_job/', 'retrieved_on': 1441856147, 'score': 9, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': \"  Some background first which is relevant. \\n\\n  I've always been considered the most academic of the family and so things like good grades and school performance reports weren't a negotiation, I was expected to work hard and get them.

Basically I was expected to be a 'good little girl' and just do what I was told. \\n  \\n  Then there's my cousin. He basically never tried at school and left at 16 with close to nothing to show for it. He was also, and still is to some extent, allowed to do as he pleased.

Me, being a little bitch for some reason (probably too nervous about confronting a friend, especially with a 4-5 hour drive in front of us), didn't really say anything.  I kind of passively agreed with everything he was going on about as if I was only half paying attention.  I somehow got dragged in to his plan to go confront the service desk.  He did all the talking while I just kind of sheepishly sat there and presented my own lift ticket when he asked.  They didn't reimburse him.  Instead, he would have had to buy a second one day pass which would have been about $20 more total than just getting the two day pass in the first place.  In a final act of angry principal he refused to buy the ticket and starts heading to the car to leave.  I guess he expected me to go with him but seeing as how I paid full price and wanted to ride the entire second day (this was at like 10:30), I told him that I was going to stay and ride.  He ended up staying in his car (he drove us) for a few hours while I stayed on the mountain.  I did come back earlier than I would have otherwise, but I'm sure it was still boring as fuck for him.  One thing I will say though, is that he had really been being a jerk for the entire trip.  He had bitched about everything from how far the restaurant was from where we were staying, to the people we shared the lift with to how much this mountain sucked compared to the ones he normally goes to.  If he hadn't had been such a dick for the past two days I would have been willing to compromise or help him out in some way, but at this point I wasn't feeling too generous towards him.\\n\\nThe ride back was pretty awkward.\\n\\n\\n\\nWas I the asshole?\", 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA for making my friend sit in the car on a ski trip?', 'url': 'http://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/21gs5t/aita_for_making_my_friend_sit_in_the_car_on_a_ski/'}, {'author': 'Avocadokadabra', 'author_created_utc': 1370107055, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'author_fullname': 't2_bw0ko', 'created_utc': 1395935326, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'edited': 1395959160, 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/21igkp/aita_am_i_overreacting_over_noise/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '21igkp', 'is_self': True, 'link_flair_css_class': '', 'link_flair_text': 'too close to call', 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 28, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/21igkp/aita_am_i_overreacting_over_noise/', 'retrieved_on': 1441851835, 'score': 8, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': \"**TL;DR**: I get up early to go to class, they stay up late.\\n\\nMale, 20 years old.\\nI've been living with 3 roommates (males 21-21-25 years old) for a year and a half.

I\\'m a high school junior(17) and I have been hanging out with this girl I have an interest in. She however is only 14 so there is some age and maturity difference. So I have been hanging out with this girl exclusively with another guy who is a senior(18) I had asked her before we hung out the first time to go to a movie with me and about a month later to my birthday which was also a movie. She said yes to both of these and then about a day before said something like Oh sorry I have &lt;some excuse&gt; I\\'m so sorry I can\\'t go. This annoyed, me after the second time I was thinking about confronting her but decided against it because if by some chance these were legitimate wouldn\\'t want to be the fool who accused her. So more info about the senior we\\'ve been hanging out with, he is extremely obnoxious often flipping off other driver and yelling,\"FUCK YOU\" or telling her to \"SHUT THE FUCK UP &lt;name&gt;\" he also often breaks the law (i.e. stopping in the middle of the road reversing for about 50 feet, going 90mph). Even if this is meant to be satirical I don\\'t find it funny and have had to deal with this in order to hang out with her. I texted her one day that I wanted to get lunch with her on&lt;day&gt; and what she thought, she responded no less than 5 mins later saying how much fun we\\'d have and how she\\'d love to go(some additional info: we had a school performance(8-10:30AM) that morning followed by the banquet that following afternoon(6-12PM)) I said I\\'d meet her or pick her up to go to the restaurant at 12. We get to that morning and we are talking about it and she still confirms that we are going to have so much fun and it\\'s going to be great. So the performance ends and we both leave agreeing to go. \\n\\nI text her to be sure she\\'s arriving at the restaurant at 12(it was 11:30) she says she feels bad for not inviting him(the senior) and says we should hang out another time. \\n\\nI told her if he was a good friend he\\'d understand. She then text something along these lines,\" &lt;My name&gt; it\\'s &lt;his name&gt; I don\\'t understand and don\\'t think you two should go.\" \\n\\nI call up the senior and ask hims whats up he says he has no idea what I\\'m talking about and says he doesn\\'t care if we go.\\n\\nI tell her this she says \"There are plenty of other times we could go with the senior.\"\\n\\nAt this point I was done with the bullshit.\\n \\nI told her that \"If you don\\'t like me to just tell me to my face instead of pretending\"\\n\\nTo which she said,\"DON\\'T SAY THAT\" \\n\\nI reply with,\"Then stop acting like it. &lt;his name&gt; doesn\\'t care you shouldn\\'t feel bad.\"\\n\\nShe replies that \"it isn\\'t a big deal\"\\n\\nTo which I say, \"It was to me I\\'ve had a really bad week(my phone was stolen the day before) and was really looking forward to this\"\\n\\nI then inform her of the other 2 times she has blown me off. I said I didn\\'t care those times but this was the third time.\\n\\nAfter she tells me I\\'m overreacting I reply, \"You know what maybe I am, I\\'ll make you a deal if you make plans with me for another date(as in time) and follow through I\\'ll completely forgive you. Without &lt;senior&gt; or anyone else.\" \\n\\nShe has yet to reply and completely ignored me at the banquet. I feel really terrible even though I\\'m pretty sure I was absolutely justified to be upset. I\\'ve only got opinions from people I know so I feel they\\'re a little biased. Also should I try to make up with the girl or just not try until she apologizes. Being on bad terms with her is probably a bad option because she will be in my group next year and senior would have graduated plus my best friend in the group is quitting and my 2nd best is graduating. \\n\\n**TL;DR Girl I like blows me off for 3rd time, I get upset and tell her off, she gets upset at me, I feel bad**\\n\\nUPDATE: First of all thanks for all the wonderful responses.

Here is my story.. \\n\\nI have two jobs (three jobs, but that one is more of an every once in a while moving job that my friend owns). Anyways, My main job is I am a cook at a nicer restaurant in the small college town I live in. I have been working there for about 3 weeks now. I really enjoy it, and it is going to be my main source of income for now. I make $9.00 an hour and work 5 days a week. I like working there and the people I work with are pretty cool and there is not a lot of hostility it seems and an overall pretty positive working environment. \\n\\nThen there is my other job. \\n\\nI have been working in a food trailer since around... early February I would say. I found this job through that moving job I referred to earlier. A few friends and I were hired by the owner of the food truck and his wife to help unload the truck they had rented as they had just moved from an Apartment to a house. He was sort of awkward around us, but I just chalked it up to nervousness or just that awkward conversation people have with strangers to fill in the silence. \\n\\n  Skip ahead to when I start working for him. Things were pretty good, I really like the food truck business and have a plan on owning  my own someday. When he hired me, he told me he wanted to bring someone in who would be interested in learning the food truck in and out and that someday he would want to train someone to learn how to make his food and eventually help run it with him. I understand that things like that take time. It is his business and I have in no way expected to run this thing by myself or anything. I have always had the mentality of \"working your way up\". However, there have been a few problems. \\n\\n   This guy is awkward. Like really awkward. I totally understand that, I have a little anxiety that makes me sometimes socially inept, but I have pretty good control over it. But my boss has a mixture of awkwardness that is coupled with jealousy of other food trucks and customers that don\\'t \"get\" his food (He makes an asian dish that uses the word \"Pizza\" at the end, and he has no signs or anything telling people that his is not traditional \"pizza\"). In some cases, he is downright rude to customers. I don\\'t jive with that. \\n\\n He also has this petty hatred (obviously out of jealousy) of another food truck in town because they are extremely popular. Every time I work for him, he always makes comments about how ridiculous and stupid people are who \"never think outside the box\" when referring to their taste-buds. He also makes comments about this guy to other people. I am afraid that I am going to be branded as a jealous loser like him since I am the only one who works for him (aside his wife occasionally). The food truck community is pretty tight around here and I don\\'t think talking shit about customers or other food trucks, especially when they help him out, is a very smart move. I have brought it to his attention twice and he continues to do so. \\n\\nThere is also the fact that I work maybe once a week. And once a month there is a food truck festival that all the food trucks in the state meet up and cook in our major city. It is once a month, and the last time we did it, we ran out of food 3 hours before everyone else because he refuses to write portions out and he under=prepares every time. He complained the whole time about not making anymore money, but it was due to his negligence that we didn\\'t get to cook more. His wife has told him that he should write everything out, I have said the same thing. I thought this was basic knowledge when working with food. \\n\\n  My last check was $31.01 and my next one will maybe break $80.00.  As I said, I have a main source of income. I enjoy my other job, and I am learning things about cooking and really taking an interest in it. This food truck thing feels like it has run its course. I just don\\'t think working maaaaybe 3 times in a month is worth the hassle and the potential fallout with other food trucks in our tight community. Especially since I have brought it up to him. But for some reason I still feel like a dick because I told him I\\'d work for him this summer. Also, certain events coincide with my main job (which I started after working for the food truck) and they are big events, but I can\\'t just take off from my other job to do these events once a month. I have to save money and work this summer becasue I am moving into a different house at the beginning of summer. This is something I also told him and he promised me more hours, but I have not had any since having this conversation. \\n\\n WOuld it be shitty to call him and tell him I gotta quit today? He has scheduled me for my days off of my other job, and I do not think working 3 hours at 8.00 bucks an hour and listen to him complain about customers and food and other food trucks is worth getting up in the morning anymore... \\n\\n\\n\\n', 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'default', 'title': 'AITA for wanting to leave this job?', 'url': 'http://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/25yrer/aita_for_wanting_to_leave_this_job/'}, {'author': '[deleted]', 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'created_utc': 1400591365, 'domain': 'np.reddit.com', 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/260zfd/aita_for_this_post_in_our_community_subreddit/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '260zfd', 'is_self': False, 'link_flair_css_class': 'not', 'link_flair_text': 'not quite the asshole', 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 6, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/260zfd/aita_for_this_post_in_our_community_subreddit/', 'retrieved_on': 1441348132, 'score': 10, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': '', 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'http://d.thumbs.redditmedia.com/jdFQ4s6FTBF7hAIW.jpg', 'title': 'AITA for this post in our community subreddit?', 'url': 'http://np.reddit.com/r/OceanicTagPro/comments/260mvp/noob_got_angry_in_a_pug_because_he_couldnt_score/chmkbls'}, {'author': 'CaolAnimation', 'author_created_utc': 1370494321, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'author_fullname': 't2_bxx8c', 'created_utc': 1400801926, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/2695uk/made_a_joke_about_my_dysfunctional_family_dynamic/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '2695uk', 'is_self': True, 'link_flair_css_class': 'not', 'link_flair_text': 'not the asshole', 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 13, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/2695uk/made_a_joke_about_my_dysfunctional_family_dynamic/', 'retrieved_on': 1441344256, 'score': 10, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': \"[So here's the comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/26801m/ladies_and_gents_meet_my_mother/chos9mc)\\n\\nOut of nowhere, this immediately got downvoted into oblivion.

I had taken her to pick up her prescription and just to do a little shopping. I led her out to my car and got her situated before realizing I forgot my change (my grandma likes to chit chat with the cashiers and we all got caught up). I ran back inside and had to wait a bit so the cashier could open up the register again. When I came back out my grandma was seriously freaking out about it and she asked me to pray with her that the kid would be alright. (I looked into it, notified the police as to what my grandma thought she saw and long story short it was just a very short woman and her husband)\\n\\nMy grandma told my entire family about how I comforted her and prayed with her. She knows Im not religious and that I rejected christianity more than a decade ago and I still remind her every holiday that I don\\'t pray but I didn\\'t have the heart to not hold her hand in that situation.\\n\\nA couple of my relatives took that as a \"Well I guess Kry\\'s finally found Jesus\" and they started pushing it on me again pretty hard. I got plenty of \"see it\\'s not that hard to just hold hands, you don\\'t have to even really pray\". They just couldn\\'t understand why I\\'d still refuse to hold hands. \\n\\nI got pretty ticked and told them me holding hands while they prayed was like them holding hands with a bunch of people worshiping Satan. Needless to say that didn\\'t go over well and a lot of my relatives are not speaking with me right now.\\n\\nSo... Am I the assshole?\\n\\nEDIT:Just as a clarification (and I know nobody said that I was but) I\\'m not just being an obstinate child by refusing to hold hands. I feel very strongly about the subject. \\n\\nI\\'ll try to condense a long ugly story but my mom kicked me out when I was 19 over an argument that started because I told my younger (I\\'m the oldest of three children) siblings that they didn\\'t have to pray if they didn\\'t want to. I started refusing to go church when I was 12. I didn\\'t even have a good reason back then but something inside me resisted everything they were telling me and when I finally got around to reading the Bible that cemented my distaste. I never actively tried to sway my little brother and sister because they adore me \"Anything Kry says has to be true\". I wanted them to come to their own conclusion but I obviously couldn\\'t hide that I didn\\'t believe what the rest of the family believed. I was past 18 so she was under no obligation to support me anymore but it still hurt to have my mother tell me I wasn\\'t welcome in her home as long as I was poisoning the minds of her other children. \\n\\nI don\\'t mean to offend people here but the idea and the act of prayer sickens me and I will not be a part of it.

I never thought it was a bad thing, I get some bundles from there and they usually have great value and I get to decide where the money goes (developers, charity, or humble bundle).\\n\\nWhat I didn't expect was to be downvoted so heavily (my top comment is now positive, but the rest are very negative and even that top comment is highly controversial in terms of up/down and it isn't Reddit's algorithm, as it was at -14 earlier).\\n\\nPeople have even begun to accuse me of being a Humble Bundle employee (I'm not). Am I an asshole for defending a service that I think is good?\\n\\nEDIT: I should probably mention that I legitimately wonder whether or not I should just let this sort of thing go in the future? I saw the other side as being childish, but perhaps I was also childish? Fanboyish? I don't know.

Someone was saying that all college aged women are getting laid all the time. I wanted to make the point that if you actually look at the people you know, that\\'s not the case. So I listed a few of my closest friends and what their love life has been like. For instance, \"One friend had a boyfriend in high school but not since college,\" \"One friend has had a lot of hookups.\" I didn\\'t say anything judgy, just stating facts. Well perhaps you could read where i said \"most of my friends are not conventionally attractive\" as being offensive, but we live in a very looks-oriented area (imagine LA) and we have had discussions about how all of us don\\'t really look like the people here. No personal info, no names except that they are females in their 20s. Could describe any group of women anywhere. The account was anonymous. No one knew that account name and I had never connected it to my identity. The comment was sitting at 0 karma and was like a reply to a reply to a reply. I thought nothing of it.\\n\\nA couple months ago, my friend (we\\'ve been friends for a couple years) stumbled upon the thread after it was linked on tumblr for some reason. Reading through it, she came upon the comment and was able to connect that that friend group sounded just like ours. So she asked me and my other friend who reddits if either of us posted it. I was like, wow, I can\\'t believe you found my old account in a post from a year ago. Good thing I didn\\'t say anything bad about anyone! And then she explodes. She said that this was a terrible thing to do to someone, that she wouldn\\'t even do it to someone she hates, that she knows I was mad at her for other reasons (not discussed here, but I was not actually mad at that point), that she was crying and felt like I\\'d put up all her personal info to be judged by the mouthbreathers of reddit. She showed it to another friend who was also referenced in the comment and said that the other friend was also angry so it wasn\\'t just her.\\n\\nThroughout this entire thing (all via text), I immediately apologized and said of course I didn\\'t mean to hurt her, that there\\'s no way anyone would know it was talking about her specifically, that obviously we have different definitions of what constitutes \"confidential\" and that if this sort of thing bothered her then I would not talk about her again at all on reddit. But it was kind of like shouting into the wind. She was very very upset and just barrelling through anything I said, saying intentions don\\'t matter, I\\'ve hurt her terribly and she never expected this from me, she wouldn\\'t do this to her worst enemy, that I reduced her to just demographics and sex life, etc. Then she said she was done with the conversation, so I let her have space. She\\'s pretty hotheaded and stubborn so I figured we could revisit it later with cooler heads. Later I saw that she\\'d made a passive aggressive post on her tumblr about me, saying I was acting like I\\'d \"lived her life\" and she was doing the same thing to me as I did to her.\\n\\nNow we\\'re at about 2 months where she (and the other friend she told) has not talked to me and is actively avoiding me. Mutual friends say she\\'s still angry (or so I heard about a month ago). She\\'s one of the few people around for the summer so I wish we could hang out again. This has been weighing on my mind for a while but I\\'m not sure if there\\'s anything I can do. I miss her but I\\'m not going to reach out and try to contact her if it\\'s just going to make her angrier.\\n\\nMaybe my idea of posting personal stuff is warped since I\\'m so used to discussing personal issues through the anonymity of the internet/reddit. She mainly just uses tumblr, which is connected to her name/face, so I don\\'t think she does the same kind of thing as I do on reddit. I asked my boyfriend and my best friend if they thought I was out of line (because her reaction to me seemed way disproportionate to what I actually wrote) and they were both stumped as well. Our friend group is also pretty gossipy/open and nothing I posted wasn\\'t something we all didn\\'t already know about each other.

I had already given up hope finding a place and was accepting my pending homelessness. I was grateful to finally find a place, even if it\\'s next door to Bruce. I was even grateful to Bruce for helping me.\\n\\nAs I was moving in, Bruce invited me over to his place to have a coffee/smoke break. It was kind of annoying because he\\'d pop his head out every 30 minutes or so to invite me over, and I just wanted to finish my moving, not stop every half hour. I only took him up on his offer 3 times in the 3 days it took me to move.\\n\\nNow I\\'m all moved in, and Bruce thinks we are best friends. He talked me into getting a game on his computer for his son, and when he saw how easily I did it, he started telling me all the things wrong with his computer he\\'d like me to fix for him. I could fix his computer, but I don\\'t want to deal with the hundred bing toolbars and viruses he has on that thing, especially with his attitude. If I messed something up, he\\'d tell me I owe him a new computer, even though he wouldn\\'t pay me for trying to fix it. Fuck that. I played dumb like I didn\\'t know how to fix any of those problems.\\n\\nEvery time I walk in or out my door, he hears me and comes rushing out to invite me over. I can\\'t go anywhere without declining his invites/promising to come over later.\\n\\nYesterday, I was out all morning, and managed to get back home and inside without him catching me. Of course, right after I shut my door, he knocked. I ignored it, just didn\\'t feel like dealing with anyone. He continued to knock every 30-45 minutes all afternoon and night. After about 5 knocks, he called and left a message which I didn\\'t respond to. Even after leaving the message, he chose to continue knocking every 30-45 minutes.\\n\\n**Tl;dr** I know I owe him something for helping me find a home, but if I grow a backbone and tell him that we will never be friends, am I the asshole?', 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'default', 'title': 'I want to tell my new neighbor to leave me alone, will that make me the asshole in this situation?', 'url': 'http://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/27a8m9/i_want_to_tell_my_new_neighbor_to_leave_me_alone/'}, {'author': '[deleted]', 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'created_utc': 1402106179, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/27iq89/aita_for_snapping_at_him_for_criticising_my/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '27iq89', 'is_self': True, 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 0, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/27iq89/aita_for_snapping_at_him_for_criticising_my/', 'retrieved_on': 1441322579, 'score': 1, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': 'We own a dog together and he doesnt activly dicipline our pup.

This has been one of the worst arguments we have ever had, with her giving me an ultimatum to either clean up my act or have her leave. I, confused and upset with myself about this whole mess, decided to talk with my mother about my problem. In my girlfriend's and her friends' eyes, I am a jerk who manipulates her and causes problems. To my mother, my girlfriend is the one who causes the problems and manipulates me. Today, I resolved my issue with my girlfriend by promising her to not be as paranoid as I have been before. Only now, she refuses to come over because she feels like my mother hates her, and she claims that I have started another major problem in our relationship, although my mother only claimed that she disliked the way my girlfriend treated me during our argument.

Although she was very upset with me and gave me a one month warning to clean up my act, she acted as if she doubted my ability to make things better with her. This made me very upset throughout my whole vacation, which is the reason my mother is upset with her. In addition, during my vacation (where I had little to no reception, so talking to her was almost out of the question) she decides to inform me that she was going to hang out with my best friend, a male, for one day that I was gone. She told me not to worry about it. To show her that I'm making a major attempt to not be jealous and possessive (as the best friend she was to hang out with had rudely pointed out to me a day prior), I told her I was not worried about it. After my vacation I tried to ask her if she was glad that I was making improvement. Instead, she once again treated me coldly, claiming that I shouldn't have been worried in the first place. This also upsetted my mother as my girlfriend had left out the fact that she needed help getting around (as she was home alone for the day), which in turn made her claim to hang out with my best friend seem as if she was trying to spite me for being jealous/possesive.\", 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'default', 'title': 'Am I the asshole for talking to my mom about my relationship problems?', 'url': 'http://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/28pi1n/am_i_the_asshole_for_talking_to_my_mom_about_my/'}, {'author': 'potentialhijabi1', 'author_created_utc': 1397933950, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'author_fullname': 't2_g7j7j', 'created_utc': 1403346497, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/28ppeg/aita_for_going_against_my_manager/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '28ppeg', 'is_self': True, 'link_flair_css_class': 'not', 'link_flair_text': 'not the asshole', 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 12, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/28ppeg/aita_for_going_against_my_manager/', 'retrieved_on': 1441302226, 'score': 14, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': \"This will likely be slightly complicated.

I went, along with my mother, and I drove everyone there in my car. The event wasn't that far from my house, about 5 miles away. \\n\\n  During the course of the night my mother proceeded to get pretty drunk. She'd began with a couple of glasses of wine, which I personally didn't give a toss about, but by the end of the night she was wrecked drunk, having drunk a lot of whiskey, and was shouting and screaming and just generally being totally fucking annoying. She also proceeded to argue with two people at the party, pissing them off, over some totally ridiculous thing she said (still not too sure what she said though). \\n\\n  So skip forward to the end of the night, around midnight, and it was time for people to leave. At this point, I told my mother that if she wanted to get home, she could get a taxi home, as there was no way on heaven or earth I was dealing with her idiotic behaviour. If anything, I'm not that confident driving at night, and having a drunk idiot to deal with would only make things harder. \\n\\n  But this isn't the first time she's done this either. There was an almost exact same time when she did the same at a family wedding, having become similarly plastered drunk, despite warnings from various family members, including my uncle whose car myself and my mother were travelling in, not to do so. I choose not to go out with her socially because I know all she's interested in is getting as shitfaced as possible. This is a 44 year old woman and her attitude of getting wrecked as fast as possible is more fitting for a kid. \\n\\n  The next morning, I got a metric ton of grief from my mother, who **demanded** that I give back to her the money she spent on a taxi home, and she kicked off about how I'd 'dumped' her and how she was 'just having some fun' and how I was 'being an asshole' for leaving her. I pointed out to her that I wasn't responsible for her behaviour and wasn't there just to act like some glorified babysitter for her to act like an A-grade moron, given I wanted to enjoy myself too. \\n\\n I should add as a last note that I am **not** against anyone drinking, and the alcohol isn't really an issue for me. I personally couldn't give a toss whether someone wants to drink or not.

On the first day we went out to the lake and came back, I dropped my swim trunks, ray bans, and hat off in my room (on the floor, right next to my bed), and went back upstairs to hang out. It should be noted that my room had access to the back yard, but that it was in no way a heavy traffic zone, and yeah, putting them on the ground probably wasn't the best choice.\\n\\nThe ray bans were given to me as a high school graduation gift in 2011 from my grandma.

I told him that it wouldn't have been that big of a deal if he had come forward about it, but instead I had to pry it out of him, and in the end, he didn't so much as begin to apologize.

The first year, I was a senior in college and he had graduated a year earlier and co-founded a startup. Of the guys I\\'d dated, he was the most put-together, the most reliable, the most attractive, the LEAST argumentative (we never ever fought), and I felt had the most potential. At the end of the day though, I felt as if he didn\\'t \"get me\" like my other partners had, but as it was his first real relationship I decided not to give up on this great guy.\\n\\nUpon graduation, I was offered a job 900 miles away. Rex had his company back home and couldn\\'t leave. I wanted to break it off right then and save myself the pain, but he and his sweet words convinced me we could make it work. Neither of us believes in soulmates so we thought if we put in the work we could make it happen. I moved, he stayed, and our long-distance relationship began.\\n\\nAnd by LDR, I mean my chronic loneliness. I am not an outgoing person, I didn\\'t know a single person in the whole state, I walked into my empty apartment crying almost every day, and I clung to Rex for comfort. We alternate turns to take a flight and got to see each other maybe every other month. He truly tried to be there for me, but those happy weekends when he came down would only make me sadder when he left again. He said what he could but I knew my depression was wearing on him and us. At one point he told me just to stop talking about sad things. I knew I had to turn things around, and luckily I was at a company full of young transplants like me, so I began forcing myself to go out on weekends. I flourished. I made friends, got to know the new city, and was finally smiling again. The problem with this new life was that Rex wasn\\'t a part of it. He didn\\'t know the people I talked about and couldn\\'t relate to the culture I was now a part of. I live in an awesome place, and when I would tell him about the fun times I was having I felt like I was rubbing it in his face. I felt completely torn; like I had to choose between a life of sadness with Rex and a life of happiness without him.\\n\\nFF to this January–I was laid off from my amazing job. I got a freelance gig to pay rent while I found a new job while all those friends I made moved away. By this time things were worse with Rex. Not that we were dysfunctional, but instead of growing closer as two people are supposed to do over time, we grew further and further apart. I felt single 99% of the time. When he would visit, I would get annoyed at another person being in my space and it took me a while to warm up to him physically again. I couldn\\'t see marriage in our future (truth is I think I\\'m too young to see marriage at all), and I wanted to break it off what was left of our relationship because we were both pouring so much emotion, effort, and money into this thing. I wanted to do it in person of course and the next opportunity was February. My parents were supposed to be visiting before he got here, but their flights got messed up and my mother, father, and Rex all ended up staying with me that weekend. How could I break up with him in that situation? I decided to wait until the next opportunity.\\n\\nBefore that opportunity came, Rex\\'s cofounders kicked him out of his own company. It was a terrible situation, his world was crashing down, and I still considered him my best friend so I just didn\\'t have the heart to break up with him in a time like that. We always said when we were free, we\\'d be together again. I wanted to stay here and he didn\\'t want to go home or stay in a college town so naturally he wanted to move here for me. Even though he was hurting from his situation I knew I could not let him do that. How could I let him move his whole life for someone who wasn\\'t nearly on the same page relationship-wise? I also knew that since I had lost all my friends, we would cling to each other and not go out and meet new people. I flew back home, and I ended it. I felt awful, and of course he accused me of only dating him \"for his company.\"\\nNot even two weeks later, Rex\\'s best childhood friend committed suicide. I found out on social media and broke down crying at work. I immediately called him and left a message just to know if he needed to talk he could. This great guy had just been betrayed by his company, his girlfriend, and his friend. We went through a couple weeks of txting/calling, that would go from friendly to \"fuck you\" in a second. He left it at \"I\\'ll reach out when I\\'m ready to talk to you again\" and I left him alone.\\n\\nI had told Rex that I wanted to be single for a while because I hadn\\'t been single longer than 3 months since I was 16. But life is funny sometimes, and I unexpectedly found a new guy who I just CLICKED with immediately. He thought I was funny, he loved to dance, we could talk forever, and it made me wonder why I\\'d spent so many silent, danceless nights with Rex. Like I said, I had felt single and alone for so long. But it was only about a month after the breakup so initially I tried to hide it from social media to not hurt my ex. However, he started posting pictures of his new girl and I assumed all was well again.\\n\\nOne of the last things Rex said to me was to let him know if my address ever changed. I\\'m going through a move to a new apartment now and texted him to let him know. He texts me back to let me know he\\'s in bed with his new girl talking to her about how terrible I am and how neither of them can fathom \"what kind of person\" would have done what I did. He said I was mean during his hard times, even though I tried to be there for him as much as I knew how. He couldn\\'t believe I was dating someone, even though he was doing the exact same thing. The text ended with \"I could give a shit about anyone like you anymore.\"\\n\\nI know I should just move on and not care, but I am so hurt. I\\'m the type of person that can\\'t deal with anyone being upset with me, it just kills me to the core. Just because I didn\\'t want to be with him romantically anymore doesn\\'t mean I stopped caring about him as a person. The timing in this whole thing was the worst it could have possibly been.\\n\\nWas I in the wrong? Should I have let him move his life to a new city to support him in his time of need, knowing that I didn\\'t want to be with him? What could I have done differently? Does he truly hate me, or was that just an emotional response?

I have always known that this is not the career path that I wanted to take, but in fear of disappointing them, I never told them and ended up actually attending a semester at a very nice college with the hope that it would grow on me. It only made me even more sure of my decision to quit and go into a field that only requires specific training. My mom was understanding and more supportive than my dad, who has never been the same since. Everything up to this point only serves as contet for the actual altercation. \\n\\nI was 18 when this happened. I had been home for a couple of months and searching for a part-time job by my parents\\' demand. I was sending out dozens of applications, but my complete lack of prior experience was making it difficult to even get a call back. One day my dad gets home from buying pool chemicals and tells me that they had a help wanted sign on the door and for me to apply online for it immediately. I didn\\'t have a problem with this, so I went to the website to check the listing. It was a 21+ management position. Later, he asked me if I applied, and I told him that I was underage and not qualified so I didn\\'t bother. This made him very angry, telling me that I would do what he said and to send in the application anyway. I repeated that I was 18 and have never had a real job before, much less a management position. We argued back and forth with the same thing for a bit and it eventually came to him saying \"I\\'ll just apply for you. Give me your resume and be quiet.\" I said \"I don\\'t have one, so you\\'ll be sending in nothing,\" to which he replied \"Don\\'t be a smart ass.\"\\n\\nA little more context to go with the first bit: I had heard my father curse only once before this, and it was after a severe injury, so this marked a serious escalation in the seriousness of situation where my family is concerned. The tone he used in saying this was very agressive and threatening, so my 18 year old reaction was that I wasn\\'t going to take verbal abuse from anyone, so I said \"Was the language supposed to drive the point across harder?\"\\n\\nAnd this broke him. He got up from his chair and started walking toward me saying \"How about I beat your ass right now?\" My adrenaline replied \"Do you want to try?\" At this point my mom ran in screaming at my dad to stop, and he backed away from me but continued to the heart of what he was going to say. As best I remember it, he said \"I\\'m sick of your fucking bull shit and I\\'m sick of you. I pay out the ass for your school your entire life and you thank me by dropping out of college after one semester and pursuing a white trash job. You\\'re an ungrateful little shit and it makes me want to leave this house.\" And then he stormed off. \\n\\nNow to the present, I\\'m still at home finishing up mechanic\\'s school, and our relationship is still very awkward. We rarely speak. My mom has always sided with me on this situation, reminding me that his mother was severely bipolar and his father killed himself, so he probably inherited a mental illness and to not take what he says too personally.\\n\\nThe way I see it is that there were many times in the fight where either of us could have ended it more peacefully, but in the end it comes down to my dad not being supportive of my career choice and selfishly wanting me to do what he wants me to do.\\n\\nAm I the asshole?\\n', 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA in this altercation with my father?', 'url': 'http://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/2b1kyp/aita_in_this_altercation_with_my_father/'}, {'author': '[deleted]', 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'created_utc': 1405693427, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/2b1ql0/am_i_arguing_with_my_dad/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '2b1ql0', 'is_self': True, 'link_flair_css_class': 'ass', 'link_flair_text': '(minor) asshole', 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 13, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/2b1ql0/am_i_arguing_with_my_dad/', 'retrieved_on': 1441262536, 'score': 15, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': 'I asked my father yesterday if he could drop me off at a friend\\'s house today.

We had a pretty good friendship, but ultimately, I ended up going above and beyond quite often. I have gotten up after 2 am on a couple of occasions to rescue them because they can\\'t drive (they still do illegally on occasion, hence why I would have to rescue them...one got caught and I have to take the other to jail to bail them out and drive them home). I even let them live with me for a period of time because they got suddenly kicked out of their place. I don\\'t think I have been in a spot where I needed them in any type of emergency situation, but I don\\'t think I hold that against them.\\n\\nFast-forward to modern times:\\n\\nMy fiance and I hang with them about once or twice every two months. Not very often. I asked if they would be interested in taking photos for our wedding, to which they gladly agreed. We hadn\\'t talked pricing or anything yet, though I expected it soon. Two months go by and not a word from them. I reach out and we hang again, I bring up the wedding photos again with them. This time they have a \"guesstimate\" number. They say $1000 is normal, but they would only charge me $500.\\n\\nMy friend photographer has yet to graduate from film school and has never shot a wedding before in his life. My fiance and I discuss the offer and decide to try to work it down to $400 instead of $500. We try to set up a time to meet at the venue to discuss photo opportunities. Anytime we are busy, seems to be the times they are wanting to meet up. As if trying to postpone going to the venue. I had to practically beg them to even go in the first place. The female didn\\'t think they should have to go at all.\\n\\nWe are now under a month from our wedding and still no set in stone photographer for our wedding. We decided to check thumbtack. We found a photographer for $400, she set up a time to meet at the venue, sent a contract, and a questionnaire within a few hours of us responding. My friends had done none of this.\\n\\nI text them to say that I don\\'t think we could afford their prices and that with a wedding coming up, things are getting hectic and it makes it difficult to plan open times to meet for us. I get a 7 message text discussing how we will not find a better deal then them, and how they were trying to \"help us out\" and how they were putting their schedule around ours just to do this. Basically, calling me a dick for not using their services.\\n\\nI am quite upset now. I haven\\'t decided what to send back, it\\'s been 2 days now. I don\\'t even know if I want them in the wedding. I feel I had helped them out a lot in the past and I didn\\'t ask for anything in return, I was offering my help because they needed it and the one time I need some help, they are being extremely difficult, rude, and unprofessional.\\n\\nTheir possible point of view:\\n\\nThey have a child, they also have no jobs in which they have steady paychecks. They will babysit for some income and they will attempt to shoot music videos or housing walk-through and the like for a business they are trying to establish. Maybe they really are struggling for free times to do things like this.

The details in the post should be enough to identify me if they stumble upon this post, but my sister has, in the past, looked up my post history and used it against me.  Anyway,\\n\\n**Back story**\\n\\nIn 2009, my fiancee and I were renting an apartment when my grandmother went into a rehabilitation facility after a fall.  My family was pretty sure she wouldn\\'t be coming back home, and they asked my fiancee and I to move in.  They told us at this time that we would be renting from them under the terms that:\\n\\n- They would charge us a rental fee equal to the mortgage amount, no more and no less (so we were basically paying the mortgage but the house wasn\\'t in our name and we can\\'t claim it on our taxes)\\n\\n- When we were ready to buy, they would sell the house to us at [Market Value - 10% - {however much money we had paid in rent so far}]\\n\\n- If something ever happened to them, they would leave the house to us in their will.\\n\\nIn 2011, we got married (yay!) and we were going to start saving up to buy the house.  They told us at this point that they realized they couldn\\'t fulfill the terms of the \"MV-10%-paid\" plan they previously suggested, that they would lose too much money.  We would just have to pay market value. ($130k)  We asked the price, they told us, and we balked.  We said it was out of our price range ($80-100k) and we would be looking around.\\n\\nWe contacted a realtor, got preapproved, we were going through a first time homebuyer class that, if completed, would pay our down payment and closing costs (up to $5000) on the house.\\n\\nOnce my mom found out, she got really worried.  She said she wanted us to stay in this house.\\n\\nA point relevant to the story that is important and complicates matters that I had neglected to mention to this point is that our house is next door to their house.  We share a yard (and we\\'re not really outdoor people so their use of our yard is like 95% to 5% compared to our own), they have two sheds in our yard for storage, my father keeps a bunch of stuff in our basement and my mother keeps a bunch of stuff in our attic, so clearly they have an interest in not wanting us to move beyond just \"I want my kid next door to me\"  Anyway, moving on...\\n\\nWe reminded them that we could not afford the house at the price they were asking and were going to have to look elsewhere.  Eventually, my mom told us to stop looking for houses; that they would do \"whatever it takes to get you this house.\"\\n\\nThe deal they were offering was: They would sell the house to us at $130,000, with a $30,000 gift of equity.  That GoE would be our down payment on the house, which would allow us to avoid PMI and would put our loan amount at $100,000 (which was within our price range).  We accepted.\\n\\nGoing through the homebuying process, our lender had a house appraiser come out and appraise it.  The house appraised for 120k (10k less than what their appraiser said).  They weren\\'t happy but still agreed to go through with the deal rather than have us look elsewhere.\\n\\nIn April of 2014, we became homeowners.  Everything was going fine, until...\\n\\n**Recent events**\\n\\nEarly last month I came out to my mom as transgender.  I\\'ve felt this way for a while but had been scared to tell her.  I was afraid they might kick us out of the house if they knew, which was why we wanted to move first.  We accepted the deal on this house because it was a good deal; we wouldn\\'t have accepted it otherwise.\\n\\nMy mom has been taking it rough.  When I first told her, she seemed fine, but she later said that she was in shock.  Eventually she asked me if I knew [that I was transgender] before they sold us the house.  I said yes.  She accused me of deceiving them and screwing them and ripping them off.  I asked, \"If I had told you when we were renting, would you have kicked us out?\"  She said yes.\\n\\nShe later rescinded that \"yes\", said she didn\\'t mean it; she was angry.  She apologized, but still insisted upon how we tricked/screwed/deceived her.  I asked \"Would you have sold me the house if I had told you before you did?\"  She said no.\\n\\nTo this point, we hadn\\'t told my dad, yet.  Whenever I brought it up, she shot it down, saying he should \"go to his grave without ever finding out about this\" and other such things.  Meanwhile, she was smoking heavily, drinking heavily, and she repeatedly dropped hints that she might be doing pot or acid but I don\\'t know if they were true or bluffing.\\n\\n**Last week and Sunday**\\n\\nLast week, she said she wanted everyone to sit down together and we were going to tell my dad.  That was scheduled for the Sunday that just passed (7/20).  At the table were my mom and dad, my dad\\'s pastor, my sister and her husband, me and my wife, my mother in law and her son (my wife\\'s brother).\\n\\nI told him, to which he admitted that he knew, he had known for a month (My mom told him) and the pastor had been counseling him for the past month.\\n\\nHe immediately dove in to the matter of the house, that they felt deceived, and that I needed to \"make it right\".  I told him \"When we\\'re ready to move, I will sell you the house back.\"  \"At the same deal we gave you?\" \"Yes\"\\n\\nHe says \"Good.  That makes me feel better.  That\\'s water under the bridge.\" and we begin talking about me for a bit...\\n\\nEventually though, it comes back to the house.  He insists that we must sell it back to them before 12/1 of this year, otherwise they will have to pay capitol gains tax on the money they made on the house if they do not reinvest it, and they will need that money to afford to buy the house back.  He says we can go back to renting from them, under the condition that \"you don\\'t escalate the situation or try to throw it in our face.\"\\n\\nWhen pressed for details, he was basically saying that he doesn\\'t want to see me \"dressed like that\" or \"acting like that.\"  I pointed out that I\\'ve been going out in public like this for the past three years and they haven\\'t noticed.  The pastor chimes in by asking my father \"What if you do run into him by accident, then what?\" (still using a male pronoun for me)  My father says \"I can let it go, ONCE.\"  I ask \"So what happens after once, then what?\"  And he just sort of deflects.  I asked for examples of \"rubbing it in his face\" that I wouldn\\'t be allowed to do, he doesn\\'t want to see \"any rainbow stickers on your car\" and was a huge stickler about when I said \"sometimes I take the trash out at night in a skirt, but you\\'re usually in bed that late\" to which he keeps pushing that I need to get changed if I do this, just in case he comes outside and sees me.\\n\\nI tell them I can\\'t agree to these terms, and there\\'s a dispute where they insult me for \\'changing my mind\\' (paraphrase) when I make it clear that I said I\\'d sell it back *when we were ready to move* and that I could not possibly come up with enough money to buy a house by December (even, and I\\'m being extremely generous, if I could come up with $500 a month in savings, every month, for five months, that\\'s still barely half of a down payment) short of winning the lottery.  I tell them we could be ready to move in 2-3 years, this is unacceptable to them, they\\'re pushing that December 1st deadline on me, HARD.\\n\\n**Events over this week**\\n\\nMy mother called me on Monday to try to persuade me to change my mind and I declined.  She called my wife and talked to her as well but didn\\'t get anywhere.\\n\\nShe called me again on Tuesday to try to persuade me again with no luck.  She says to me \"Your wife came to me in tears and sat there on my couch and PROMISED me you would make it right.  Are you going to honor your wife\\'s promise or not?\"  I tell her I will need to talk to my wife.\\n\\nMy wife vehemently denies it.  The following transpired in a separate room on Sunday, while I was still chatting one on one with the Pastor after everyone else had left the room. \"I was on the couch, *she* came to *me* and asked me to sell them the house back.  I said we would, but I didn\\'t say when or how and I was NOT crying.\"\\n\\nYou\\'d think this was one of those hearsay moments but as fortune would have it, she and I were having some friends over after the family talk, and one of them showed up early and came next door (my mother let them in), so they were sitting right there on the couch next to my wife.  I called them and they confirmed my wife\\'s account of the events, insisting that my mom was full of shit.\\n\\nAt this point, my wife doesn\\'t want to talk to or see my mom, and my mother in law gets wind of it and is pretty livid, too.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, my mom calls my wife as soon as I leave for work.  My wife didn\\'t answer, so my mom comes next door, lets herself in, and begins a conversation (less a conversation and more a \"I\\'m going to talk and you\\'re going to listen\") with my wife.\\n\\nNow, my wife is the sweetest person ever.  If you were so inclined, she\\'d let you walk all over her and apologize for being so lumpy.  She tells me, \"It\\'s a good thing I was at the top of the stairs and she was at the bottom, cause otherwise I would have slapped her\".  In the seven years I\\'ve known this woman, only one other time have I ever seen her this angry.\\n\\nMy mother in law told me that my mom apparently left her a message.  She played it back to me; it was a combination of snippets of truth, peppered with distortions of things I had said reworded into things I hadn\\'t, and ended with \"I\\'m sorry my son is ruining your daughter\\'s life.\"\\n\\n**The current situation**\\n\\nMy parents don\\'t even want to talk about \"the transgender thing\" until I \"make it right\".  If I don\\'t sell them the house before 12/1, they probably won\\'t be a part of my life anymore, and if they will, it\\'ll be a wreck, considering I still have to live next door to them.  My sister has been remaining mostly neutral but she\\'s siding with them in that if I don\\'t give them what they want, she won\\'t want me around either.  (Although she has added that \"if you do give them what they want and they try to screw you, I won\\'t be talking to them, either)\\n\\n**Am I the asshole?**\\n\\nSo I deceived them by not telling them I was transgender before they sold me the house.  Have I basically made my bed and now I need to lie in it?  Or are they being unreasonable by expecting me to sell it back so quickly?

In order to lock down a place for us to live in September I had asked him to check out places. I had looked online and emailed landlords, but he didn\\'t have a car to go down to check them out.

He said he \"wants a lazy day before he goes on his trip\" I asked him what trip he was talking about and he said he had decided to go on a two week long fishing trip with his buddy on his commercial tuna fishing boat. \\nI flipped out and told him I was really worried about finding a place to live and now he\\'s gone for two weeks and I\\'m supposed to move out there in two weeks. He said his dad could look at houses and he needed this trip to make money. I was yelling at him and telling him he was immature and that me and his dad was doing more to help us find a place then he did. He said he really needs the money and he\\'s gonna make a lot as a deck hand. \\nI said he was \"an asshole and being really immature and had been lazy and irresponsible all summer and that I would just find a place by myself and he could find his own place or sleep on the street cause he\\'s too much of a baby to figure his shit out\"  he told me it works both ways and if I had come to visit him we could have found a place earlier.

Hell, in grade 10 he nearly got mugged for saying that he believed God didn\\'t exist.\\n\\nSo, flash forward to today. I was talking to his girlfriend, R, during class. R is a very religious, girly, powder-puff Southern girl, which we\\'ve all found ironic considering what we thought to be true. \\n\\nI mentioned offhandedly that he wasn\\'t very religious when we were referring to a teacher of ours that would constantly insert religious references into her teaching. R had said that J didn\\'t care for that teacher very much, and I mentioned it was probably because of said references due to his beliefs.\\n\\nR seemed shocked, and said, \"But J goes to church with me!\" I was shocked, but then I said, \"That\\'s odd, because J regularly hangs out with (other friends, all non-religious) and I and we always shoot the shit about it.\" She got visibly very sour and said \"Well, I don\\'t want him hanging around you guys!

I told her about it and asked if shed like to be my maid of honor. She told me that untill she met him and talked to me about it she didnt want to make a choice. Ok, no biggie. Lets see if we can make plans. Hes only free weekends, and he works late into the night. She is the opposite.  She is unwilling to give up her free time during the weekend ( which admittedly is very little) and when asked if she would be ok with just talking to me she said fine. So I tell her when im comming up next ( I live two hours out of town) and ask if we could meet up. We pick a day and she says shell text me when shes free. At 5 pm she texts me telling me she cant meet today. Im slitly irritated because I had other things that needed to get done but didnt because I didnt want to miss her. I didnt let it show because I figured it wasnt all her fault. Her job keeps her late and the ride home is over an hour. Anyway everyday for the rest of the week I ask if shes free. Everyday she eventually says no. Saturday rolls arou d and she says no but we can tomorrow.  Sunday in the am I send her a text asking for a time and a place and I get no response. Nothing. I ask again four hours later and still nothing. Finally at seven pm she texts saying sorry but its no happening. I got pissed. So I said A\", ive been here a week trying to meet eith you to discuss this. I dont understand why youve put me off.  We agreed on this. I dont even understand why you need this to happen. My fiance is a good man. Why would you doubt that?\" I got a garbled response about how my fiance had nothing to do with it and how she just needed to know.  Know what I dont know. But aita for feeling hurt that she doesn\\'t trust me to make romantic and life decisions on my own? As a side note,  while weve been friends for around 15 years, we have not been together all that time. We are both individual people, and we know that. She didnt like that I got a little irritated with her  and hasnt talked to me since.  Ive reached out twice I think with no responce. But one of the times she posted that she was cleaning out her friends list and for anyone wanting to remain friends to post on the status. I did with a long winded apology and ended with I hope we can be friends again. I never got a response.  Not even a like. Everyone else who posted got comments on their post or got a like. She didnt touch mine. That hurt too.... but she also didnt delete me. Im so confused about this that when I come across a post of hers that I really like or agree with or want to lend support I dont know what to do. I feel like if I push to hard to fix the relationship shell get upset and end it forever. But if I dont push hard enough things will never change. So... aita? And if I am what can I do to fix it?\\n\\n\\nEdit: thanks for all the support. All of this is pretty out of character for or her, and im not asking her to pay for anything.

He saw the car and liked it straight away, and was happy with my asking price of £200. \\n\\n Everything went fine until this week, when I finally handed over the keys to the old car, having got the new one (yay!), and thought that was the end of it. Now at this time, we agreed that he would give me a deposit of £100, with me giving him a couple of weeks until he'd pay me the rest. This was fair enough as I know him well and knew he wouldn't mess me around. \\n\\n  Then a few days ago, I got a call. R had taken the car for a look over by a mechanic and was banging on about how it was going to cost £X to repair Y and £X to repair Z. Now at the time he first saw the car, I had pointed out to him that the car was in need of some attention, and he had still chosen to buy it. Similarly, I'd offered the car at a massive discount to offset the money which would need to be spent on it in terms of maintenance, and this was again something I mentioned to him at the time. \\n  \\n  Then there was the debacle over the tax disc. I'd initially wanted the car to be out of my hands a lot sooner than it did, and if it had, the tax disc wouldn't have been something I'd have had to deal with, as the car's ownership documents would have been transferred into the new owner's name and so this would have been something they'd have had to do (costing another £100). But because the car sold when it did, there was a massive amount of confusion about who should pay for the disc and when. Eventually I agreed to do it and paid, but that left me minus £100 I should have had. \\n\\n I had hoped in this case that the £100 that R had given me for the deposit would ensure at least that I broke even after paying for the tax disc, but that's when the other problem started. R phoned me and started dropping hints about how much the repairs were going to be and how he'd have to make a payment plan with the mechanic to cover it. Now to my mind, anyone who owns a car has to take some responsibility for the costs of doing so. I couldn't see why I should be flinging money at a car I didn't even own any more. But he wouldn't get off my case and so I agreed with him he could have the £100 deposit back towards the costs, but he would still owe me the rest of the money. \\n\\n  So now I'm going to walk away from this deal with pretty much nothing because of this, and for a car that isn't even my responsibility any more.

I have been working as an escort for about 16 months now. As a college student, it is a wonderful source of income because I make insane money per hour and so only need to work a tenth - maybe even a twentieth of what other college students are working to finance themselves. This was all well and good until about 12 months ago when I met my boyfriend. At the beginning we just met through mutual friends and enjoyed hanging out. Pretty shortly after, we ended up hooking up and right after I immediately came out to him as a sex-worker. When I told him this, he didn't seem to mind at all. In fact, he seems really interested in it, asking a lot of insightful questions and also remarking that he was pretty turned on that he was getting what other people payed so much for.  He also remarked that he didn't think it was too big of a deal because he usually only dated in an 'open-relationship' paradigm where sex with others is not cheating. This is the kind of relationship I like also.\\n\\nNeedless to say I was totally thrilled by this because to be honest I thought that I would be single for as long as I escorted. I couldn't imagine someone being comfortable enough with it that they could date me. I was also really into him, so obviously this response of his propelled us into a relationship, which over time has become very serious and intimate. We now live together and for the most part are very happy together. \\n\\nHere's the tricky part. For awhile, his words rang true. I was always honest with him about when I was working and at what hotel in the city (He insisted on knowing for safety reasons) and he didn't seem to mind at all. In fact he would occasionally drive me or pick me up afterwards and we would talk about our day/how it went with no awkwardness or tension at all. However, in the last 4 months or so I have noticed his attitude change. It isn't every time I work, but some nights (especially nights where I see regulars) he is very subdued and quiet when I get home, or else he can be totally passive-aggressive. The weird thing is that whenever I bring it up he denies that it bothers him. I don't want to stop doing sex-work, because I genuinely enjoy it and there isn't anything else a 22 year old could do and make 300/hr. That being said, I am very in love with him and hate the idea of hurting him.\\n\\n This situation has become very frustrating because I never tried to hide what I do and was very upfront with him before we started dating that this is a part of who I am, and he now occasionally makes me feel guilty for it. I recognize that it is not an easy thing to accept in a partner, but if that is the case then I feel like he should have told me from the beginning.\\n\\nYou might have guessed that the open relationship part has become less than wonderful too. When we were newly dating we both hooked up with others on occasion (maybe once a month or so) and were honest about it. However, recently he has stopped engaging in sex with other people and says that he only feels attracted to me. While I am deeply into him sexually and romantically, I still have the occasional desire for a one night stand. Again, I feel somewhat manipulated because I now have loads of guilt about that desire even though we talked about it before dating and clearly laid it out as acceptable. \\n\\nAm I the asshole reddit? I am certainly a handful, I will make no claims against that. I know that it is not easy to date a sex-worker, and I know that he has insecurities about his body. He has confessed a fear that I will leave him for someone 'more attractive'. i find this totally ridiculous, because I adore his body. He is 'beefy' but I really like that, and he knows I like that. \\n\\nI guess I'm just looking to hear from a third party about this situation.

Last year, his sister got married in a small ceremony at their parents\\' house. She and her partner were planning to travel abroad for both work and honeymooning, so they wanted a marriage license to cut down on nonsense if something happened while they were out of the country. It was a small, lovely ceremony with family and basically-family only. They had plans to have a larger party later on for all their friends back home.  \\n  \\nFast forward to this year. I\\'m now in graduate school and my partner and I only get to see each other on weekends. This sucks mightily and I really treasure the time we have together now. I get really, really annoyed when anything interferes with our time together. This weekend is the sister\\'s second wedding. And when I say second wedding, I mean it\\'s another ceremony with the same person she\\'s still married to, but this time with the family AND 200+ guests AND a huge amount of pomp and circumstance that I\\'ve heard my \"in-laws\" planning. The sister\\'s family is all going, including the extended family, and of course, my partner, all of whom were there the first time. I\\'m not attending, as it\\'s a 6+ hour drive for me and graduate school waits for no one. And, you know, I was there the first time when they actually got married.\\n  \\nSo, here is my question: Am I the asshole for thinking this is a hugely selfish thing to do on the part of the sister? God bless her if she wants to have a huge party with her friends at home who didn\\'t get to go to the first ceremony. But making all of her family up and mobilize to watch her get married...again? Why not do it right the first time? If this were the only ceremony, I\\'d totally understand and would even try my darndest to attend, but now I just miss my sweetie and think this whole thing is a huge indulgence and a waste of time.', 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'I think my \"sister-in-law\"\\'s second wedding is stupid...AITA?', 'url': 'http://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/2fntbb/i_think_my_sisterinlaws_second_wedding_is/'}, {'author': '[deleted]', 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'created_utc': 1410039858, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'edited': 1410122480, 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/2fo3p5/i_spent_160_of_my_own_money_on_necessities_and_my/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '2fo3p5', 'is_self': True, 'link_flair_css_class': 'not', 'link_flair_text': 'not the asshole', 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 10, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/2fo3p5/i_spent_160_of_my_own_money_on_necessities_and_my/', 'retrieved_on': 1441183567, 'score': 7, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': 'Perspective:\\n\\n-I\\'m still in high school\\n\\n-She won\\'t allow me to get a job (she says I should do extracurriculars instead) (edit: which I do plenty of)\\n\\n-Ever since I had to spend it she said she would pay me back\\n\\n-It was on toilet paper, food, school stuff, etc.\\n\\n-I spent it in July and it is now September\\n\\nI wouldn\\'t care that much but it was all my birthday money, and I need a new wallet, so I was going to use it to splurge on a nice one.

I tell him to move it, but he refuses.\\n\\nLater on, he ends up dropping and breaking the controller (he technically broke the mechanism that connects the right trigger to the circuit, which renders RT unusable. Therefore, the whole thing is useless because RT is so universaly used). I inform him of this, and tell him he can get me a new controller or reimburse me for my purchase. While normally I wouldn't care, this particular controller was the only one that worked with the computer, so I cannot play games that require a controller now (emulators).\\n\\n----\\n\\nFast forward to now: my brother announces that he is planning to buy a new hunting game (with what funds, I don't know, since he doesn't have a job and has been known to take money).

He at first dodges it, claiming the controller isn't mine, then that he didn't brake it (even though I have a witness), followed by his flat-out refusal to purchase it. \\n\\nNow I am planning to take his new game and withhold it from him until he reimburses me for the controller he broke.

My parents divorced early and I lived with my mom from 6-13 in Ohio, whereas I had been in Texas before. Anyway, When I was 13, I came home from school one day and my mom had been arrested for like the 5th time for doing drugs. But this time was permanent. (I haven\\'t seen her since.)\\n\\nAfter that, my grandma drove up to Ohio from Texas to get me, and brought my dad with her. Then we drove back, and I moved in with my grandma. My grandma is awesome. Anyway, I found out shortly after moving in that my uncle would also be living with my grandma. My uncle is 40. He has \"mental problems\" as my grandparents describe it, so they use that as an excuse to put up with his bs, such as leaving messes everywhere, trashes my grandmas car, never having a job, and they said he will probably never move out because is isn\\'t capable.\\n\\nSo that went on for about 2 years, and oh man I hated it. His blatant disrespect for how lucky he was made me so angry. He was practically sucking financial resources out of my grandparents for free because he was lazy. Two years of rent free life. That combined with the fact that he is an enormous jerk really makes me hate him.\\n\\nAfter those 2 years, my grandma brings up that my dad, back in Dallas (I live in a very small town about an hour away) has been living on the streets long enough, so she lets HIM move in as well. When HE moves in, he does the same thing as my uncle. Freeloading, whining, being ungrateful, and just generally being a drain and a pain in the ass.\\n\\nHaving to live with these two constantly makes me dread being home. It has made me really sour. I literally never smile when they are around, and I never speak to them. When they speak to me I just answer with quick one word answers and try to end the conversation as quickly as possible. My uncle still lives here, going on nearly 4 years (I\\'m 16.). My dad has been here for about 3 months, but he is no closer to moving out than he was when he got here. I am constantly reassured he will be gone as soon as he gets his first paycheck, but he doesn\\'t have a job and I\\'m not holding my breathe. My grandma knows I am super unhappy with them being here, but she and my sister both say I am being a dick. They say that my dad and uncle are family, and I shouldn\\'t hate them, that I should give them more chances.\\n\\nSince my entire life all of my family, besides my little sister and grandparents, have been drug addicts, failures, and freeloaders, I never really learned to value family. I just don\\'t feel it. But I do feel intense anger towards both of these gents.\\n\\nSo there you go, reddit. Am I justified?

like i said, i work hard. i dont have a drivers licence because, up until recently, i *sucked* at driving. i even scared my driving instructors lol. i actually have plans to go ahead and take the test now since i think i can pass. apparently he didnt know that. i dont have a job so i can focus on school. then somehow the part about me never cussing him out got worked into the conversation. i responded with \"youre pushing it.\" and not long after that i left the room giving him the cold shoulder to anything he said.\\n\\ni know when im tired i get cranky so im not sure if i overreacted, but im still pretty mad over this now (to be fair im still tired lol).', 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AMA for my comment i made towards my moms boyfriend and my attitude towards him now?', 'url': 'http://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/2lcln7/ama_for_my_comment_i_made_towards_my_moms/'}, {'author': 'Eeazt', 'author_created_utc': 1338571636, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'author_fullname': 't2_7v92g', 'created_utc': 1415295462, 'domain': 'imgur.com', 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/2lhqbm/is_this_mansplaining_im_feeling_bad_now/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '2lhqbm', 'is_self': False, 'link_flair_css_class': 'not', 'link_flair_text': 'not the asshole', 'media': {'oembed': {'description': \"The most viral images on the internet, curated in real time by a dedicated community through commenting, voting and sharing.

She would have let you relax or calm down if you needed to\" but it\\'s not as simple as that.

We were decent friends and we would hang out a good deal. After he got married, no one really saw him again. He was around, but was busy with his marriage and finishing up his degree (we were both in the same year of undergrad in different majors).\\n\\nSo we drifted apart. And then about 2.5 years ago, we basically stopped talking completely. He had moved off campus and was commuting to classes. It\\'s cool. It happens. And neither one of us really made an effort to hang out with the other or make contact at all.\\n\\nFast forward to 2013- I proposed to my girlfriend and we started the engagement process. We started making invite lists and had to trim them down drastically. We got to my friend and decided that it would be alright if we didn\\'t invite him and his wife. He had a bit of an argumentative attitude and we knew that he probably wouldn\\'t get along with one of her family members. Plus, we figured it would be one of those situations where they knew we were getting married (yay for Facebook) and would be happy for us, but would understand not being invited since we had drifted so far apart.\\n\\nLast week, I received a series of texts from the first friend saying that they are severely hurt and upset that they included me in their wedding and now they don\\'t even get invited to ours. \\n\\nI told him that I could see where he was coming from, and that we would love it if they could make it.\\n\\nHe gave me an address to send an invitation but told me that he probably couldn\\'t get the time off work. \\n\\nMy thought was, \"Sooooo...you want me to send you an invitation to a wedding you weren\\'t invited to...so that you can say that you can\\'t make it?\"\\n\\nAm I in the wrong here? I get that I was his best man, but we honestly hadn\\'t talked for at least two years.

She has gotten me into this band also, and even though I had heard a few of their songs before, it\\'s really to her credit that I listen to their music right now. But anyway, she has been into the band for probably over a year now. Recently, popular acts like One Direction, Taylor Swift, and 5 Seconds of Summer have cited the band as a favorite of theirs, giving them an influx of new fans who have not liked the band for as long. On top of this, the band is very popular with the \"hipster\" crowd online (especially on tumblr) and she seems to fit into that crowd on this issue. She often complains about the new fans, claiming that she is a bigger fan because she has followed the music for longer. She tends to get a very (excuse me for the bias here) elitist attitude, going as far as to say that the people who haven\\'t liked the band for as long as she and some of the other fans have are only pretending to like them because it\\'s somewhat the cool thing to do right now. She was very vocal in her complaints about the \"fourteen year olds\" who apparently are not mature enough to like this music and are only doing so because they saw One Direction tweet about them or something. She also claims that the concerts are \"kind of ruined now\" because all of these younger fans act viciously and violently to get near the stage and scream at the boys on stage, although I didn\\'t see much of anything even close to this when we saw them in concert. She maintains that I couldn\\'t possibly understand how violent fourteen year old girls are at concerts because I am a boy. In addition, I have pointed out that these fans are in exactly the same spot years ago when she was close to that age with acts like Justin Bieber and One Direction. I really don\\'t mind her opinion, and it\\'s not like an issue that we fight about or anything, but if it comes up I just kind of shake it off and nod my head while she rants about something I completely disagree with. I do not judge her for this nor do I think it\\'s my place to try to \"correct\" her, but I just kind of needed to get this off of my chest and also confirm that it isn\\'t ridiculous for me to be annoyed when she brings something like this up.

On my way there, I stopped at a liquor store and bought a decent bottle of vodka, trying to be a good guest.\\n\\nSo I got there at about 9:45, and went up to her apartment. Her new boyfriend was there, along with my friend's flatmate (gonna call her R) and her boyfriend. So I got the vodka out, everyone's happy to see it, and we played some drinking games for a while, nothing too crazy, mainly blackjack... feeling like a little bit of a 5th wheel here, but nothing too awkward... and yes, i had asked my friend if me being there was ok.  \\n\\nBy 11, the vodka was finished and the five of us were all pretty drunk, and my friend ended up reading Pride and Prejudice in the corner. I went and talked to her for a while, and eventually I took the book and read a few lines out in a kinda Mr Darcy voice, nothing too loud or annoying, I just like reading aloud..  \\n\\nWhen I did that, R came over to me and tried to rip the book away from me. I hung on to it, we ended up struggling for it, eventually she slapped me in the face and threw the book, hard, at my friend... and R and I ended up yelling at each other, eventually I went back to my beanbag and she came over and tried to knee me in the balls. At this point, R's boyfriend came back from the bathroom, and I made a dumb joke about how he'd have to keep R on a leash or face getting his balls bitten off.. which he laughed at.  While we were drinking, another one of my friend's flatmates had come in from work, and she ended up giving R and I this long spiel about how we need to calm down, etc., especially me because it wasn't my home... I was a little bit snarky and she ended up telling me to shut up and stop trying to have the last word.. but eventually everyone calmed down a little.  \\n\\nAt this point, R went out to the balcony area, I figured she'd gone out for a smoke.. But she stayed out there for ages, and eventually my friend's boyfriend tells me that I should probably get going, and I realized (way too late) that R's really, really offended.  I got my stuff together and left, but when I was outside the door, R's boyfriend came out, and told me that if I ever treated R like that again I'd be waking up in hospital.. I managed to calm him down, shook his hand, and told him to tell R that I was sorry if I'd offended her.  \\n\\nI got home a while later, went to sleep, woke up at 4 and realized that my friend had made a little offhand remark once about R's 'happy pills'.. i.e., she has problems and she's way more insecure about stuff than her whole mouthy exterior lets on. \\n\\nI feel incredibly insensitive, and I'm not going to be able to go back there for a long time, but am I the asshole? \", 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': '[AITA] for dealing badly with a stupid drunken situation?', 'url': 'http://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/2p7rda/aita_for_dealing_badly_with_a_stupid_drunken/'}, {'author': '[deleted]', 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'created_utc': 1418576710, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/2p9sui/aita_for_scaring_lots_of_people/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '2p9sui', 'is_self': True, 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 0, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/2p9sui/aita_for_scaring_lots_of_people/', 'retrieved_on': 1441020309, 'score': 0, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': '██████████████████████████\\n███████▀▀▀░░░░░░░▀▀▀███████\\n████▀░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░▀████\\n███│░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░│███\\n██▌│░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░│▐██\\n██░└┐░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░┌┘░██\\n██░░└┐░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░┌┘░░██\\n██░░┌┘▄▄▄▄▄░░░░░▄▄▄▄▄└┐░░██\\n██▌░│██████▌░░░▐██████│░▐██\\n███░│▐███▀▀░░▄░░▀▀███▌│░███\\n██▀─┘░░░░░░░▐█▌░░░░░░░└─▀██\\n██▄░░░▄▄▄▓░░▀█▀░░▓▄▄▄░░░▄██\\n████▄─┘██▌░░░░░░░▐██└─▄████\\n█████░░▐█─┬┬┬┬┬┬┬─█▌░░█████\\n████▌░░░▀┬┼┼┼┼┼┼┼┬▀░░░▐████\\n█████▄░░░└┴┴┴┴┴┴┴┘░░░▄█████\\n███████▄░░░░░░░░░░░▄███████\\n██████████▄▄▄▄▄▄▄██████████\\n███████████████████████████\\ufeff\\n', 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'default', 'title': '[AITA] For scaring lots of people', 'url': 'http://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/2p9sui/aita_for_scaring_lots_of_people/'}, {'author': 'RickSantorumKingUSA', 'author_created_utc': 1347324961, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'author_fullname': 't2_8yxna', 'created_utc': 1418749570, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/2phf4z/aita_for_assassinating_president_kennedy/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '2phf4z', 'is_self': True, 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 0, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/2phf4z/aita_for_assassinating_president_kennedy/', 'retrieved_on': 1441016694, 'score': 0, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': '', 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'default', 'title': 'AITA for assassinating President Kennedy?', 'url': 'http://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/2phf4z/aita_for_assassinating_president_kennedy/'}, {'author': '[deleted]', 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'created_utc': 1418781187, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/2pj6s9/aita_dryer_incident/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '2pj6s9', 'is_self': True, 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 3, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/2pj6s9/aita_dryer_incident/', 'retrieved_on': 1441015869, 'score': 4, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': '**Waning**: according to everyone so far, I am the asshole.\\n\\nSo, it\\'s near break and the whole school is rushing to do laundry. \\nThe laundry room is packed, there are no machines open, it\\'s not fun. \\nSome dryers are stopped, maybe a minute or two. \\nI concede I didn\\'t exactly wait around. \\nBut my stuff in the washer was done. \\nI checked the dryer that was stopped, the clothes were dry, so I put them on top of the dryer and put my stuff in it, start it.

I didn\\'t know because my laundry has been hot for many hours after, but then I have a basket. And apparently? they fold better when hot. Again, I don\\'t understand this, and didn\\'t know this. But, idk...\\n\\nAnyway, so I\\'m waiting for my other load of clothes to get out of the washer, and this black girl comes in and ask: who\\'s clothes are these (pointing to the washer). I teller the clothes inside are mine, the clothes on top I don\\'t know. And with one hell of an attitude she informs me the clothes on top are her\\'s. Me: Oh, okay (I\\'m a little taken back at this point, but I figure no harm no foul we\\'re cool. I\\'m trying to be polite). She ask why I decided to take her clothes out. I, still trying to be polite and casual, say because we need a dryer and her clothes were dry, so I put them on top. And she\\'s all (that\\'s right \"she\\'s all\") but I wasn\\'t that late. So I said, yeah,... but we needed a dryer. I thought that was the end of it, no big deal in my mind. \\n\\nWell, she kicks my laundry basket out of the way (this is nothing in my mind, I mean it was in front of the dryer and her stuff was on top) and she starts putting her stuff in her laundry bag. But then opens the dryer. I\\'m a little confused so I walk over. And she starts pulling my stuff out and tossing on the floor. At this point I\\'m dumbfounded. I don\\'t even know how to react. I manage to get out and \"uhh\" and she stands up with one of those smart ass shakes and and starts walking away. \\n\\nNow, here\\'s where I made my ***big*** mistake. After realizing what just happened I said: \"Or you could be a bitch about it.\" and I started picking up my laundry and putting it back in the machine. I curse casually, but in hindsight I think that was the wrong place for it.\\n\\nIn case anyone\\'s wondering the big mistake was calling a black girl a bitch in up-state new york.

However these people had mostly just dumped them on my desk, blocking about half the desk with paperwork and stuff.

Everything and I mean everything has to be about them and you HAVE to praise EVERYTHING they do (slowly dawdling a half mile around an office over the course of day is NOT exercise for fucks sake). They say how much they hate themselves repeatedly so you have to praise them and if you don't you're the WORST PERSON ALIVE. I feel like I am suffocating. I'm going to bring up their fucked up behaviour with their psychologist (they all see the same one and they're getting me into them as a client too) because I'm going to fucking die.

We have 50/50 split custody.  I am a barber by trade, I am good at what I do, and I like to cut my own children\\'s hair. I generally let the kids pick their own haircuts.  \\n\\nNow: My younger child has been growing out his hair since summer,  trying to get it long enough to tie back.  He has been bullied a lot by dad and grandma (who helps raise them during dad\\'s 50%) for liking \"girly\" things like my little pony,  the colors pink and purple, and wanting dress up clothes.  They have also been pressuring him to cut his hair for the last couple months, to which I\\'ve said \"he\\'s growing it out for winter, I\\'ll cut it when he is ready\" .  On Sunday, during child exchange time, Grandma and I get into it over this bullying.  We have a raised voice conversation on my porch about how I am forcing my child to like girly things, and causing my older child grief from the embarrassment of having a brother who likes my little pony.  I tell her she is being a bully, that my child can choose what they like to wear and what shows to watch, older kid needs to such it up, and I would see them next week at child exchange time. Good bye.  I pick up my younger kid from school today, and they have a cropped short hack job haircut from Great Clips.  My kid says grandma pressured him into this haircut, but he doesn\\'t hate it too bad.  On top of it feeling to me like an act of revenge for Sunday\\'s fight, it\\'s an awful haircut, and I had to take him into my shop after supper and fix all the uneven bits.  Bangs were crooked, cowlick wasn\\'t cut down, and it had no texture at all.  Basically a bowl cut.  I will note that my older kid, who also needs a haircut, was not taken in for a Great Clips haircut.  I cut his hair this evening. \\n\\nI text ex husband and tell him that I\\'m a Barber,  I want to cut the kids hair.  It\\'s my job,  my passion, and my kids.  He says it\\'s just hair,  doesn\\'t matter who cuts it. Can\\'t see why this is important to me.  I try to stand my ground, tell him that next time I want to cut the kids hair and he tells me I\\'m being an aggressive ass and making waves for no reason.  \\n\\nI am fucking livid, man.  And I can\\'t tell if I am being unreasonable or not, because I am so wrapped up in the bigger picture -  bullying of my kid for having non-conforming interests, and feeling like this haircut was a direct attack for challenging the family matriarch.  \\n\\nSo what do you think, reddit?

He and I have been having problems for years but always manage to make it work (very strong personalities, but love each other anyway). But in the last six months has been some of the most stressful times in our relationship. He went through the fire academy to be a city paramedic. He's starting a whole new career. It's understandable that he's stressed out and I did my best to be there for him. With some falling out, some meltdowns, a few but very frustrating financial issues to overcome, we started to get better again. \\n\\nNow here is my issue. I'm a firm believer in sexual healing. Can't sleep? Sexy time. Stressed out? Fuck session. Feeling under the weather? Pound town. I really do feel like sex is 1. A great stress reliever. 2. A good way to feel closer to him 3. Great way to relieve some tension and relax. Not to mention great for headaches. Now it's gotten to the point that I can count on both hands how many times we had sex in 6 months. Before all of this it was at least once a week (hectic jobs). I tried initiating sex a few times to be rejected.. I tried to be understanding. Maybe he so stressed out that he can't concentrate on anything else and can't perform. It's not me but the starting over of a new job later in his life then he expected.  Until I found out he was masterbating at home. I then starting sending naughty pictures and nothing.. Just a few comments on how it was sexy with no physical contact.. I myself have overdone it with self pleasuring that I'm over stimulated and can't even orgasm as often as I used..\\n\\nI feel like it might just be me he's not attracted to anymore.. All of my sexual frustration is turning into more fights and bad thoughts.. I am trying to do everything I can to make it work and help him out when he needs it. I try my best to take care of him and his needs but my needs are not really being met.. I don't really ask for much. Love me, be there for me, hear me out/let me vent, and fuck me. I'm financially independent and pay for all my bills on my own (though he had helped me when shit hit the fan). Now the relationship is in danger because of all the stress with this as the cherry on top of a shitty sundae.. What can I do?\\n\\nTL; DR \\nSO and don't have as much sex as we used to.

He is a very smart and funny guy who I\\'ve always gotten along with, but generally has problems getting along with a lot of people. He is constantly making inappropriate jokes, saying what\\'s on his mind without thinking about it, offending people, and challenging authority. I\\'ve always respected his honesty and crude sense of humor, but for these reasons he has always had problems holding down jobs. I\\'ve worked at a group home for seniors with traumatic brain injuries for about two years. One day, my friend (his fiancee) asked me if I could get him a job at my group home. I was hesitant because of his personality, but there were open shifts at the home and I felt like I needed to help him out. So, I got him a job. Immediately he started to ruffle feathers. I work with  8 other people and every one of them hated John within the first two weeks. I still loved him as a friend, but even I couldn\\'t stand working with him. He was just annoying, constantly following people around and questioning things (normal for new employees, but his way of doing it was just obnoxious and intrusive). \\n\\nThe first part of this incident happened like this…one of his running jokes with me was about \"blumpkins\". We would both basically just say the word randomly to each other to get a laugh. One day, I was teaching him how to change a client\\'s diaper. This was everyone\\'s favorite client (Henry). Henry had overheard one of us say the word \"bumpkin\" and he asked what it meant. John didn\\'t say anything and looked to me to see if I would respond. I have a great rapport with Henry as I\\'ve worked there for two years, and he asked what the word meant so I went ahead and told him. I said \"A blumpkin is when a man receives oral sex on a toilet.\" John seemed pretty surprised that I said this to a client and he said, \"You can say stuff like that to them?\" I shrugged my shoulders and said, \"Well, he asked what it was. And he\\'ll probably forget about it in 5 minutes.\" Then we moved on and that was that. Henry did forget about it. \\n\\nThen, about a month later, things had gotten worse with John and the rest of my coworkers/supervisors. I talked to him about this several times and he actually agreed that it would be best if he transferred group homes because of how bad his relationship with our manager was getting. The week before he was going to transfer, he was standing around talking to me while I was brushing Henry\\'s teeth and getting him ready for bed. This night, our supervisor was a good friend of mine who had to work with John the most and was getting very frustrated with him. While I was brushing Henry\\'s teeth, John came up to him and said, \"Hey Henry, have you ever fucked a girl in the butt?\" Henry was not amused by this question, and just scowled at John. Henry usually doesn\\'t appreciate crude humor like this and wasn\\'t in a great mood this evening. I gave John a look that said \"Don\\'t push this.\" But, he did push it. He asked the same question again and Henry became visibly upset. He slammed his fist down on his wheelchair and yelled something at John that we couldn\\'t make out. I told John that Henry had been in group homes with a traumatic brain injury since he was 18 years old, so the subject of sex and virginity is a touchy one. My supervisor witnessed this entire incident from across the room but hadn\\'t heard what anyone had said. I immediately removed Henry from the living room and took him into his room to calm him down. As soon as I got in there, my supervisor came in and asked me what had happened. Without even thinking about it, I told her the truth. The next day, John texted me and told me that she had told our house manager what had happened and that he was being investigated for verbal abuse and got put on paid leave. He then told me that I \"better be ready to lie for him\". I told him I was not comfortable lying, especially since I had already told my supervisor the truth right after it happened. John got very upset with me because I told our supervisor the truth knowing that she didn\\'t like him, and I should have known she would report the incident and he would get in trouble. He\\'s right, I should have known that, but it wasn\\'t what I was thinking about. I was thinking about Henry. His other reason for being so mad is that I taught him it was OK to say things like that to clients. \\n\\nIt\\'s now been about six months since this happened. John ended up quitting before the verbal abuse investigation even concluded. He has not talked to me since. He unfriended me on Facebook and told me that I am no longer allowed in his house. This has ruined my relationship with my best friend. I do feel a little guilty for ratting him out, but it was not my intention to get him fired or hurt him in any way. I was interviewed about all of this by HR of my company and also a rep from Adult Protective Services and I told them EVERYTHING, including the \"blumpkin\" incident, which was extremely embarrassing. Even though six months has passed, I still think about this all the time and am greatly saddened by my loss of friendship with both John and my best friend.

He knew I had come into a little bit of money and spent a lot on people I hung out with so naturally he hung out with me a lot.  He was unemployed and flat broke.  I'm not going into a whole lot of details but I bought this dude a lot of stuff.  I never asked for repayment but he said when he got a job, he'd get me back. He ended up getting into trouble for stealing a bunch of stuff from this girls house during a party when she drank too much and passed out.  Him and a bunch of people pretty much just ransacked the house stealing pretty much everything and wrecking what they didn't steal.  Some how he ends up only getting 4 months of work release.  When he goes to jail he's dating some 16 year old teeny bopper and he works with another friend of mine, (we'll call him Zach) at a Car Dealership. At the car dealership some dude traded in his horse trailer for a truck, so there's this horse trailer out back of the car lot.  Chris (dude in jail) is periodically having Zach drive his teenie-weenie girlfriend up there so he can bang her in the horse trailer.  This little act of his kind of violates my morals in some way so I devise a plan to get Chris caught.  The plan goes like this: When Chris is at work next and asks Zach to go get this little bubble-gummer for another romp in the horse trailer, I call the jail he's at and tell them about it.  So a few days later, Zach calls me and tells me he's on his way to pick the twenager up.  I call the jail and tell them about the horse trailer.  Sure enough Zach gets there to drop her off and there's a corrections officer sitting in the back of the lot watching the whole thing play out. When Chris gets back to jail from his job they were only going to not let him go to work for three days....until they found out the girl was not yet a woman.

They agree but suggest that we go see a movie at the theater anyways and just see whats playing.

The helicopter flies away and I get back up.\\n\\nAbout 10 minutes later (about 11:45) that ho gets out of his car and I get back in trying to warm up because it was so cold outside. I told him what happened and that I need to be home right now. He is driving super fast and we get home, my mom and dad are pissed.

She sat me down and said she just did not love me, and she did not want to live out our \"suburban life\" that we had planned. \\n\\nSome context:  I was 26 she was 24 at the time, we were married at 24 and 22, and had been married for just over 2 years when she decided this.  We both grew up in a smaller town in Illinois, went to the same college, and got married just after graduating.  We dated each other a total of 3 years before we got married, so it\\'s not like we just rushed into things, in my opinion.  \\n\\nWe moved out of the small town less than a year after getting married to a large suburb just outside of Chicago.  I had secured a job in the town we moved to, and not long after moving my wife found a great job in Chicago, which was a decent commute on the train every day.  Instantly our lives were very different, we went from seeing each other every day for breakfast and most of our evenings, to me dropping her off at the train in the wee morning hours and picking her up usually after dinner.  She started spending more and more time in the city going out with her coworkers and friends, and complaining that she had no friends or things to do in the suburbs where we lived.  \\n\\nWell we ended up finding a great deal on a house in the suburbs and bought it.  This was in November of 2013.  We purchased it for 100,000 with a 5,000 down-payment that I paid out of my personal IRA (a special rule allows for first time homeowners to use IRA money penalty free up to 10,000). \\n\\nAt this time her job started to take off (she is a recruiter for accounting and finance jobs), to the level that it put her on track to make $150,000 in 2014.  I make approximately 47,000 at my job, and it is salaried, no commission will increase it like hers.\\n\\nAnyway, she decided in February that she no longer wanted to be together which started a long period of me begging her not to leave, and her saying she had made up her mind and there was nothing that was going to change that.  \\n\\nI felt it was fishy at the time, I had not treated her poorly or done anything I felt was worthy of being divorced over, but she assured me she just wasn\\'t happy with where her life was going and wanted to try something different.  \\n\\nIn May of 2014 she moved into an apartment in Chicago with a few girls, and as of next week we will be officially divorced.  I tried to reconcile multiple times over the last 10 months, but to no avail.\\n\\nAll of this is important because when she split she said I could have the house, as it is not paid off, I will have the benefit of keeping the house, but will incur the mortgage myself.  By the time she left we had paid off $23,000 in total, including the $5,000 down payment.   Two days ago she e-mailed me and stated that I needed to refinance and take out an additional $10,000 that is owed to her for half of what was paid on the house.\\n\\nI do not think I owe her anything, she was living in the house and still married while we were paying on it, and she made the decision to leave.  So i\\'m just wondering if I\\'m the asshole for not wanting to give her that money?

(I have since gone to therapy and cleaned up my act). During this time, I was sometimes difficult to be around. I\\'d make plans and cancel last minute (or would be super late) because I\\'d have a breakdown and didn\\'t want to go out all puffy from crying. She was always a bit abrasive, but at that point in my life I figure I deserved it for jerking her around. \\n\\nSince then (about 5 years ago), she moved across the country, came out as trans, and comes to visit once or twice a year. She got a fantastic job out there and makes 6 figures. She bought a house, a dog, and a new BMW so she could take her old lexus apart and convert it to electric. Meanwhile, me and my SO of 10+ yrs are still living in a crappy apartment and barely making rent. I\\'m a little jealous, but I actually like my life now and I\\'m mostly happy (a huge step up from where I was 10 years ago).\\n\\n---------------------\\n**Now for the meat of the story:**\\n\\nMy SO started a startup that mostly crashed and burned. Zee loaned him some money to get it off the ground (about 20,000). It was supposed to be a short term loan, but shit happened (including an employee that embezzled ~ $25,000) and it hasn\\'t gotten paid back. She\\'s said it was cool (she makes 6 figures and is *by no means* in financial trouble) and that we could pay her back when it wouldn\\'t be a burden to do so. She told us to \"think of it as a gift\" and that she didn\\'t expect us to pay her back.\\n\\nSince then, we\\'ve dug the company out a bit and things are looking up (got a contract with a national chain! Yay!), but we\\'ve still been working our asses off and barely making rent (950 a month); All four of us in the company have been threatened with eviction in the past year. We\\'re not starving, but it wouldn\\'t take much to put us under, even now.\\n\\nZee came to visit us this week. We were attending an event that we all make a point to go to together. It\\'s expensive for us (hotel and such), but we (mostly I) save up and have a good time. We (me and SO) shared a hotel room with Zee to cut costs and some other friends of ours drove up. \\n\\nThe SO (without talking to me or Zee) offered to let our friends crash on our bed and get me and him a cot from the front desk. I was a little miffed by this because last year we were supposed to split a hotel with these friends, but they fucked off and left us with the bill (which is a lot for us). So now I\\'m supposed to smile and let them stay for free this year? &gt;:(\\n\\nThis is where I do a stupid thing. I go and have lunch with Zee and mildly vent about the hotel nonsense. She then tells me \"**You shouldn\\'t complain because [my SO] hasn\\'t paid her back yet\".**\\n\\nNow me and the SO have separate finances, and I am not really involved in the start up (though I try to help out anyway). I don\\'t get paid by said start up, and I had no part in the loan between her and my SO. Furthermore, she invested in a *start up* and anyone can tell you that any such investment carries some risk. And to top it all off, she\\'s in no way hurting from this, and for him to pay her back (even 100$ a month) would bankrupt us and probably end up with all four of us in the company being homeless. So I\\'m pretty pissed about this, but I swallow my feelings and try to defend him gently, saying that we\\'d get her her money as soon as we could. And I even apologize for being grumpy and venting to her. But she didn\\'t back off at all.  I let it go and try to have a good time, but 24 hrs later and back at my apartment (where she is staying with us) I\\'m even more upset about it.\\n\\n\\n***Am I the asshole for being upset about this?***\\n\\nShould I just let it go?

He is well aware of my feelings for him and he has told me many times that he loves me and we\\'ve also discussed that he just can\\'t be in a relationship. He gets very jealous when I am dating other guys and gets angry when we are out and another guy hits on me and I flirt back. He marks his territory in public by touching me, or giving me a kiss and what not and when someone asks if we are together, he looks at me and says \"you\\'ll have to ask her\" and because he trips out when ever he thinks I think we are in a relationship, I say, \"no, he\\'s made it quite clear he doesn\\'t want me.\" and he says, \"I\\'m a schmuck.\"  However, he has no problem hitting on other girls right in front of me and this causes us to argue and stop talking for periods of time. \\n\\nValentines Day night he met me out at the bar I was at with my friend and then went to his house and he repeatedly kept saying \"I love you\" and \"I\\'m in love with you\". I ended up hanging out with him all day Sunday because he invited me to. I left around 11:00 pm and as far as I knew, everything I was cool with us. \\n\\nTuesday I sent F a picture of a bad bruise he gave me while we were wrestling around Sunday that said \"Nice\" and he didn\\'t answer. I thought he was at work but he was home. I don\\'t know if he was sick or if he just called in to work because we had bad weather, but as far as I knew everything was still cool. Fast forward to Friday we are snowed in. F decided not to drink and R was bored so we were texting. We wanted to hang out at F\\'s and R\\'s place, but R asked F if I could come over and F said no or something like that (I didn\\'t know this was said btw). R had a couple of people coming over, but he said F was in a bad mood and asked if we could hang out at my house so we did. For some reason we ended up going over to F and R\\'s house. R lives in the basement so we weren\\'t going to be disturbing F at all. R and I walk in to the kitchen to fill our ice and F was watching TV. I said hey and asked what he was cooking, F replied and then R and I went back downstairs. We were all quiet and F went to watch TV in his room at some point. F\\'s dog came downstairs and R doesn\\'t like her being down there so I took her back up. I was in the kitchen looking for the 2 big boxes of dog treats I got her a few weeks ago, but she was out of them so I tried to give her a banana and she wouldn\\'t eat it. I was standing in the kitchen eating the banana and F came down. I hid the banana behind my back because I always sneak her treats right in front of them and they see me do it because I\\'m terrible at it F usually laughs at me. It\\'s never been an issue. Anyways, R comes up to the kitchen and F is fumbling around with something and F gives me this attitude and says \"don\\'t give my dog food.\" and R and I just look at each other with a \"what the hell?\" look. I walk downstairs and F starts bitching at R for having me and other people over there. We are in the basement, we are quiet and just because F doesn\\'t want to drink and hang out doesn\\'t mean no one else can. R and I are pissed and R decides to tell me that F told him he didn\\'t want me over there or something like that. I have no idea what this sudden problem is that F has with me. \\n\\nI wake up Saturday still pissed off at F and extremely hurt over this and fed up with all the mind games for the past 4 years so I send F a text message that said, \"What is with this sudden problem you have with me? I thought everything between us was OK. 6 days ago you were getting the biggest chuckle when [*another girls name that F wants to sleep with but can\\'t bc she thinks he\\'s creepy and she is R\\'s FWB*] fed the dog left over Chinese food, but I guess it\\'s cute when she does it, huh? 6 days ago you were telling me that you love me and you were in love with me (let me guess, you probably don\\'t remember that, right?) but now I\\'m a problem. I am so tired of this Drunk F vs. Sober F bullshit. Delete my number, never text me for anything and control your drunk ass from talking to me when you see me out. I\\'m sick of your games. You\\'re dead to me.\" and he never responded. \\n\\nR came over today and said the F is angry with me because of the text sent. F apologized to R, but I got nothing. R was acting like I shouldn\\'t have sent the text either, but I feel I had every right to say something because I\\'m tired of F messing with my head by telling me he loves me and his actions and then all the sudden I\\'m a problem and not allowed to be over there unless it\\'s him that invites me. Since when? I don\\'t go over there and raise hell and wake everyone in the house up like the girl who fed the dog Chinese food does and I don\\'t bother F when I\\'m hanging out with R and I know F doesn\\'t want to hang out. That was a punch in the face that I\\'m suddenly a problem when just a few days before he was supposedly in love with me and asking me to stay.\\n\\nMaybe I am missing something.

She\\'s flown quite a few cover layout suggestions by me (all her own work), while insisting we remove art by other people she has a beef with (I see it as feeling insecure after losing a prestigious award to them). Also, when I remind her that I have a photo I\\'d like to consider for the cover, she pulls things like this in front of our faculty adviser: \"We\\'re considering some of my photos for the cover...\" (glances at me) \"...and some other people, too.\" It feels very trivializing.\\n\\nAm I the asshole for feeling like she\\'s not contributing and wanting to see more work from her?

He made an off comment about how I *could* put lions in a picture with photoshop, and I said, that I probably could. Fast forward to tonight, and he comes up and says that he is taking the pictures now, and will need the photoshopped results tonight. At this point, I had both not realized that that offhanded comment was my agreeing to this, and that it had to be done tonight. I am thinking to myself that he could figure it out as it is his project, and he waited until the last minute to do it, and I say that I think that he should work on his own homework as this photoshop would easily be a few hours, over 50% of the project, and I have my own homework to do. I did focus on how he shouldn't rely on me for helping with everything because at this point I was annoyed with having to do so.\\n\\nMy roommate gets mad, starts yelling, and calls me a bitch and an asshole for not helping him because it wasn't a big deal, and I started yelling back as I was not going to sit there and take it. He goes on about how the photoshopping would take 5 minutes, and I am looking at him thinking that its not going to take that long, and if you are such the expert knowing how long something would take, he can do it himself. \\n\\n---\\n\\nWell, I am here several hours later reflecting on the situation, thinking if his argument has any merit, and I wanted someone else's opinion.

At 73(?) years old, she\\'s taken ill with a chronic respiratory condition that requires her to be on oxygen all the time.  She needs assistance with some tasks, but (by her doctor\\'s advisement) is capable of accomplishing most tasks independently.  For now.\\n\\nMore background:  my mother is a certified narcissist. She only cares about herself, and everyone else she considers her \"loved ones\" are there to support her and give her life structure and connection. She has always wanted only to be taken care of by the people around her.  \\n\\nAs far as her health, my mother ignores doctor\\'s advice, and cancels appointments at whim. We encourage her to be independent and active (key aspects of living successfully at any age, but particularly at her age), but she is argumentative, and refuses to do anything to help herself.  We offer support (logistically) when we can, but it\\'s extremely frustrating to deal with her, for these reasons and more.\\n\\nShe was abusive (physically and emotionally) to my sister and I our whole childhood and mentally/emotionally cruel on through young adulthood and beyond.  She was unable to help us at any stage of our life, and worse, she was a detriment to our lives for the most part.  She is a horrible person who just assumed someone would step up to take her in.  Our relationship is, at best, strained.  My mother and father separated when we were young, and she never remarried.  She has pushed away her family, and lives too far for them to be of help, even if they wanted to.  She has had money, but largely squandered it away through various bad decisions.  \\n\\nMy sister and I live alone, and live outside the city she lives in.  We don\\'t have the means to be the caretaker for her--even if we wanted to, which we don\\'t.  I feel guilty about it all the time, because I think most people SHOULD help their parents out if they can.  The fact that she has no retirement money is really the last straw for us. No life insurance money, no final expense coverage, nothing.  She is smug and matter-of-fact about it, like \"what did you guys think?\"  Maybe we should have seen it coming.  But we have our own lives to live, and we she\\'ll have to deal with whatever care agencies are available, and then a government-run nursing home when she\\'s not capable of caring for herself.\\n\\nAm I the asshole for not wanting to be stuck with this problem?? \\n\\n', 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'My mother has done nothing to prepare for retirement/old age.

Nothing was ever discussed about monogamy.  She leaves town but she devises a plan to come home a day early and not tell her family she is in town so I can pick her up for an all you can fuck buffet.  \\n\\nDuring the month or so she is gone I end up reconnecting with my ex girlfriend right before this other chick comes back and end up getting her pregnant.  She lives the next city over but I am there for her emotionally and tell her I will support her 100% with any decision she ends up making because I love her.\\n\\nI pick up the other girl when she gets back in town with a huge chip on my shoulder.  We end up having the most impersonal sex of my life and after its over I just pass out with my back to her.  Basically just screaming i dont like you with my body language.  The week goes by and over the weekend she starts to ask questions why I don\\'t call her anymore, act so distant etc but with a very angry tone.  She ends the conversation with a \"should we just never talk again?\" angry message and I just say yeah thats probably for the best.  Since its the weekend I make the drive back up to where my ex lives in the next city over.  We have a long talk, admit our love for each other, and decide to get back together.\\n\\nHomegirl starts blowing my phone the fuck up but by this time I\\'m already a city over with the girl I actually have feelings for.  So I ignore it thinking she just has to vent.  She starts freaking out that I\\'m not saying anything back and gets it in her head that maybe something \"happened to me\" and sees an opening to start creeping on my friends and random fb people asking if I was ok.  \\n\\nEventually she creeps on my ex and sends her messages about how she was looking for me and how she was with me the other day yadda yadda yadda.  Now my ex is fuming because the day I had to pick up my fuck buddy from her month abroad was the day after I found out my girl was pregnant.  She\\'s freaking out about how I could do that after finding out about her pregnancy and that I\\'m a monster.  Shits real bad for the first couple of days.  I honestly thought she would never talk to me again.  Naturally she says I can go fuck myself and that we\\'re not together.\\n\\nThe slam piece starts hitting me up excessively telling me shit like \"lets get together I wont be weird this time, I know what this was\" and other shit like \"look I just wanna have sex I promise I won\\'t say anything we can keep it a secret\"  basically anything she can to try and hook up again. My response is always the same.  I tell her it was fun and even though I\\'m not technically with the other girl Im not going to sleep with her because I need to focus on getting back in her life for whatever she\\'s about to decide with her pregnancy.  This happens a few times throughout the week, getting random desperate for sex texts with the same refusal.  Suddenly she snaps in a good way (unsnaps?), normalizes, and promises to leave me alone.  As crazy as she was she was actually nice enough to mention to my ex that I refused to do anything with her despite her advances and promises of discretion which helps her tide over the whole ordeal.  She reaches out and I tell her that the only important thing in my life at the moment is to support her with whatever happens and that I would never let her face the coming troubles alone.  we end up back together, but we break up again a year later, and back together, and break up again.  next time, she\\'s the asshole, most recent is a little more ambiguous so I will probably make another post with that one later on.  \\n\\nso 1-10 how much of an asshole am I?', 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'default', 'title': 'how much of an asshole am I? tale of two women, though not officially committed to either.', 'url': 'http://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/2xvoy8/how_much_of_an_asshole_am_i_tale_of_two_women/'}, {'author': 'notapantsday', 'author_created_utc': 1394887036, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'author_fullname': 't2_fpg8e', 'created_utc': 1425498830, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/2xxw0l/am_i_the_asshole_for_blaming_the_wrong_person_for/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '2xxw0l', 'is_self': True, 'link_flair_css_class': 'ass', 'link_flair_text': 'asshole', 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 8, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/2xxw0l/am_i_the_asshole_for_blaming_the_wrong_person_for/', 'retrieved_on': 1440872842, 'score': 11, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': 'So without going into too much detail, someone made a mistake at work.

I live in a fairly small city/town in central Oklahoma. We have a fairly large transient population due to 1) high drug use around here, 2) being on rail and highway corridors near OKC, 3) a relatively poor local economy, and 4) lots of reservations nearby (four actually within or right next to town).\\n\\nThis town has fairly limited services, but we do actually have a local library (and had a Carnegie library that was more centrally located but the town refused to maintain it, and that's another rant on my part) that is located in our decaying downtown area. So now we get to the meat of my post.\\n\\nEvery time you go in the damn library, there's hobos outside wanting this or that or the other. They sit outside and smoke all day, and leave their cigarette butts everywhere. They harass people going into the library. They stink up the place (literally, they smell fucking horrible). They're rude.\\n\\nJust the other day, a homeless guy in a wheelchair was sitting in front of the door. I offered to help him in, and he accepted. After I wheeled him across the threshold, the smell hit me-- old cat urine, cheap tobacco smoke, and rancid food. Just imagine being waterboarded with a bucket of Chinese food mixed with cat urine (from concentrate) that had been sitting out in the Texas summer for two weeks, mixed with the juices from a roadkilled rabid raccoon that had eaten nothing but skunk. Imagine the slimy brown juice sliding inexorably into your nostrils, dripping down into the back of your mouth, the hot-sweat-and-metal tang of the rusty bucket... that's how bad this dude smelled.\\n\\nAnyway, I went into the main part of the library and he stayed in the foyer... and after a few minutes, you could smell this guy in the library itself. He never went in, either. He just sat there staring at everyone as they went in and out.\\n\\nQuite frankly, there's no excuse for that. The tribes have quite a few social programs and there are two homeless shelters nearby. The only requirement for those is that you can't bring drugs or weapons in with you. These people *should not* be a burden on normal citizens, but instead they choose to hang out at our library and harass us.\\n\\nSo, fellow Redditors, I ask you...

She continued on to say that I pounced on her both times at the end of class, and accused me of stalking her.\\n\\nNow, she was very generous because she did say that if I drew up some samples and contacted her to schedule an appointment (\"at a time that I am aware of\") when we could talk, she might be able to make an introduction with the internship connection. She left saying \"I\\'m SURE I\\'ll hear from you.\"\\n\\nThe encounter left me feeling confused and hurt, wondering if I had in fact been stalking/harassing her. The idea of it made me feel queasy in my stomach and when I got home I stared into space contemplating it for quite some time. I couldn\\'t bear making someone feel that uncomfortable because of something I said or did. Was I the asshole in this situation?

Still the same work day, just a different desk.\\n\\nAnyway, long story short, my wife hates cleaning. Absolutely detests it. She says she\\'s too tired after work to help clean, and gets furious if I expect her to help clean on her days off, because that\\'s \"her only time to relax.\" However, I am expected to spend my weekends cleaning, shopping, and running errands, and I get angry comments if dishes are unwashed or carpets unvacuumed when she gets home. If she does clean anything, she makes a big production out of how she\\'s going out of her way to help, and that I never appreciate what she does around the house.\\n\\nHer reasoning is that, because her job is physical and mine is mental, I should be able to clean while I work, or that I should hop out of my office right at 5pm to scrub the counters. I\\'d like a little time to unwind too, but because I\\'m not on my feet all day, she makes it sound like I don\\'t deserve that.\\n\\nI should point out that even when the roles were reversed - I was working 10 hour restaurant shifts and she was unemployed - I was still expected to clean on days off, because she was too busy looking for a job. If I don\\'t wash the dishes one week, they just don\\'t get done. I understand that retail work is a bit more physically demanding than the mental stresses of an office drone, but I feel like she\\'s just making excuses to get out of doing the work.\\n\\ntl;dr: I work from home, and my wife thinks live-in-maid is my second job title.

Whether we\\'re at home sitting on the couch or eating dinner together at a restaurant or just generally talking to one another, sometimes I\\'ll start to talk and I notice that she isn\\'t actually paying attention. Here are some of the signs:\\n\\n1. She\\'s facing me but her eyes are looking at something around the corner, constantly shifting between me and whatever she\\'s looking at, all the while saying, \"mhmm, yeah... uh huh\"\\n2. She randomly interrupts me to point out something unimportant and meaningless, e.g. \"OH! I didn\\'t know this store was at this location! We have to go there soon. My bad, go on.\"\\n3. The infamous glued to cellphone texting someone else while trying to maintain communication with me.\\n\\nAnd the usual stuff like just zoning out, etc.\\n\\nNow I\\'m not an attention whore by any means. I\\'ve learned a lot about our relation the last few years and I know what interests my girlfriend and what I should talk to my friends about, but this isn\\'t even a specific type of conversation here. We could be talking about how our day has been, in fact she could be the one asking me this question and when I answer, she will sometimes just stop listening to what I have to say. I\\'ve gotten used to it by now, so I\\'ll even have a little fun with it sometimes. When I notice her drifting off, I\\'ll make up silly stuff to see if she catches it, like, \"Yeah so Nancy got fired today at work because an elephant walked into our office asking if we sold oversized headphones it could wear and she said we don\\'t.\"\\nOr I\\'ll just prematurely finish what I had to say, like \"Yeah so Nancy... nah nvm it\\'s not even important. How was your day?\"\\n\\nAnd now we get to the point. Recently, my girlfriend and I went to a coffee shop near by and sat down to enjoy ourselves. I started to talk about the marathon my friend joined and how we should give it a try but I noticed she was looking from the corner of her eye at this odd couple sitting next to us. She interrupts me mid sentence and says:\\n\\nGF: \"Honey don\\'t we know those two people from somewhere?\"\\n\\nMe: \"I dunno\" and just stopped talking\\n\\nGF: \"Sorry, what were you saying?\" \\n\\nMe: \"Nothing, never mind\"\\n\\nGF: \"I said sorry, jeez. Why are you always like this?\"\\n\\nMe: \"What? I\\'m just not going to waste my energy talking when you don\\'t care.\"\\n\\nGF: \"What\\'s your problem?\"\\n\\nMe: \"Nothing, I\\'m just tired of being interrupted and ignored. Don\\'t you think it\\'s rude to do that? I always listen to you and anyone else that talks to me because I actually care, but sometimes you just don\\'t care, so I don\\'t care either.\"\\n\\nGF: \"Relax, I just wanted to know if you knew who they were. Why do you have to be so sensitive about this all the time? I\\'m listening to you.\"\\n\\nMe: \"Okay, so what was I talking about then?\"\\n\\nGF: \"Fine, whatever.\"\\n\\nThis has happened to me all my life because my family has always ignored me.

And I knew he would love it to. So I asked him to read it. He said he would later when he felt like it. At that time, the situation I just described wasn\\'t really in place, so I didn\\'t think much of it. Still, it was often at the back of my head that he still hadn\\'t.\\n\\nA few months ago *at least* two years later, he decided to read it. And it was only because he decided to use it for a school project. Excuse me if I think that gives him a bit of a poor record.\\n\\nRight now, I can think of 11 things I want him to do. And I am certain there are more. I\\'d like it if he could finish the Hitchhiker\\'s Guide series (since he only read the first 1 or 2), play 5 videogames (though I think I lost one, so maybe 4), read 4 webcomics, and watch 1 short webseries. He has done none of those things. Some have been things I wanted him to do for years, while some are more recent.\\n\\nIn the last few years, despite the fact that there have been many things I\\'ve asked him to do, he has still started a bunch of things on his own. Scratch that, he\\'s gone actively looking for them. Yet, every single thing I want him to do, he says he\\'ll get to \"sometime, when he feels like it.\" I\\'m pretty sure that\\'s going to be never.\\n\\nRecently, I did get him to play a videogame. And he *really, really* like it. It was Fire Emblem: Awakening. But of course, he had to take a good thing and turn it into a bad thing. It started with one playthrough. Then it turned into one, but with frequent delays where he started the game again to test things out and do them differently. Now it\\'s his original playthrough that is still unfinished, one on Lunatic difficulty that he\\'s still far from getting through, and a promise of *another* one once he\\'s done where he will min/max character stats. Basically, it\\'s turned into a gigantic waste of time. He spends a ridiculous amount of time playing it, and yet he still seems to go through at a snail\\'s pace. I don\\'t even care about it anymore. \\n\\nI\\'ve gotten him to read the beginnings of all the webcomics I want him to read. For each one, he\\'s thought they were pretty good. And even said that he\\'ll probably read them. He has yet to read any. A couple I\\'ve been waiting for for years, the other two for months. He still isn\\'t getting around to it. And what bothers me the most is that he literally does nothing all day.\\n\\nI\\'m serious. He\\'s already gone down the rabbit hole of staying up too late every night and taking naps during the afternoon. But he just spends hours each day accomplishing so little. Today, he\\'s made a new Mii Fighter in Smash Bros., then proceeded to literally screw around with it, just running around on stages doing nothing, for hours. He\\'s currently rewatching an episode of a show he\\'s already seen. He also spends a long time checking reddit (even though he still insists he\\'s not really a redditor), checking a forum (and he refreshes it once every ten minutes), and just randomly rereading comics and blog posts he\\'s already seen. He literally thinks about how bored he is, then thinks of some random thing he\\'s already done that he can do, and does it for dozens of minutes. And yet it never occurs to him to do one of the things I want him to do.\\n\\nRight now, I\\'ve been taking a fairly active approach in trying to get him to read some webcomics. As in, reminding him several times a day that it is a thing he could be doing. He\\'s been getting pretty annoyed about it. Says that it\\'s actively making him *not* want to because of how aggravating it is. And he insists that if I just left him alone, he\\'d get around to it. I don\\'t care when he says that. Because he\\'s constantly demonstrated that no, he won\\'t. Even if it annoys him, bringing it up often will keep it in his mind. Because it never is if I let him be.\\n\\nAlso, for a while, we had a thing going where I\\'d watch/do something he wanted me to do, then he\\'d return the favor. That system worked pretty well because for a while, we were actually decent about it. We weren\\'t super strict, and we tried to actually return the favor. Until he just straight-up stopped. Not once did he ever do something in exchange for me again. Which, of course, led to me getting a bit more strict about it. And naturally, that led to him saying that he never really agreed to it in the first place. Which would obviously happen, because our system was never really meant for strict exchanges. It only worked because we were reasonable. But of course he\\'d start saying that once I had watched a ton of things he wanted me to watch, with nothing from him.\\n\\nHe admittedly does do a better job of asking once, then just letting me be. But I feel like that\\'s because I\\'ve been much more willing to do things for him. When he asks me to do something and I say I don\\'t feel like it, that\\'s usually meant that I\\'ll do it the next day. And I usually have. But when I ask him to do something and he says he doesn\\'t feel like it, that usually means he\\'s never going to do it. And 97% of the time, he hasn\\'t.\\n\\nAm I the asshole for bugging him a lot about reading some webcomics?\\n\\nSorry if I was just rambling or it didn\\'t make sense.\\n\\nEDIT: Another thing he does is maybe give something a shot *once*, then try dangling that over my head forever. With one webcomic, the one he had the best chance of reading, he once read about 14 pages on his own. Then proceeded to do nothing for weeks/months.

I found it totally unreasonable that I was being expected to cover a shift with less than 12 hours notice, and I wasn't particularly happy that her 'reason' for wanting that day off was 'because I promised my little girl we'd go shopping'. To me, the shift timetable had been up for long enough that if it had been that important, she would have spoken to the line manager and asked not to be put in a shift that day (which is entirely possible, I've done it). I told her this in a polite fashion and advised her gently that if she had availability issues, she needed to go to a manager and actually tell them. \\n\\n  Skip forward to last two days ago and she seems to be pulling the same thing again.

Sorry for the wall of text, I tried to be concise. \\n\\nI own and run a company together with three male partners. I\\'m the fourth partner, and female. A few weeks ago, I was trying to hand over an important project to one of my partners before I went on vacation. While I was briefing him, he interrupted me a number of times and went off on lengthy tangents - so often, and so lengthy, that it was becoming difficult to  give him all of the info he needed to complete the project without me. This bothered me, and I must have gotten snippy (I didn\\'t realize it at the time), because when I left the room for coffee, he turned to another partner and said: \"Do you know what I would say to my wife if she spoke to me like that?\" And then proceeded to bark in that partner\\'s face like an angry dog.\\n\\nI caught the tail end of this, and when he realized I had overheard, he repeated the whole thing, trying to play it off as a harmless joke. I was pretty taken aback and couldn\\'t immediately compute what he had just said and what the implications were. I told him that I hadn\\'t realized my tone was out of line, apologized, and that was that.\\n\\nNow, weeks later, his comment still irks me. Hardcore. This is blatant sexism, and it\\'s in my innermost work circle, I own a business with these people. The problem is, because of my vacation, weeks have passed since it happened - and I haven\\'t spoken to him about it. By now, I feel like the fact that I can\\'t let it go is more a reflection of my own limitations - my white-hot anger when it comes to sexism and my inability to be chill about it - than of the crassness of the incident itself.\\n\\nOK, so here\\'s the AITA. The fact that he said this has made me lose respect for him. I genuinely like him less, and I think it\\'s starting to show in our daily interactions. I don\\'t really enjoy talking to him, so I only strike up a conversation if I have to. The tone is always professional and polite, but I wouldn\\'t say friendly, and the frequency of our conversations has dropped. And when he interrupts me now, I just keep on talking and bulldoze right over him. This especially has made him notice that something is going on, but since the incident happened a few weeks ago, he has no idea what he did wrong. \\n\\nI should add that I was brought on board explicitly to add structure/professionalism to the company. We work in a creative field and before I joined the team, it was kind of a crazy, non-productive free-for-all. I\\'ve been fairly successful in implementing discipline, but it\\'s been a long and hard fight... Which has resulted in my being labelled as the company nag. This is the main reason why I haven\\'t brought the issue up. It is absolutely vital that I pick my battles.\\n\\nI also believe that deep-seated sexism isn\\'t something you can talk someone out of.\\n\\nAm I the asshole for not explaining to my partner how sexist his comment was?\\n\\nTLDR: Was unable to immediately call out business partner about sexist comment, comment still bothers me, it\\'s starting to creep into our daily interactions, but I still haven\\'t spoken to him about it.

Sure, each individual occurrence is too small to criminalize or prosecute, but a multitude of them can make it unreasonably expensive to pay a staff to answer your business line, or make it insane for useful officers of a business to be reachable directly by phone.

Yes, the boss should suffer, but when I think something is wrong, I don't take a job doing it.  I think it's wrong to kick puppies, and if someone offered me $15/hr to kick puppies, I wouldn't do it.  Therefore the instant I know I'm talking to a robo-dialed salesman or pollster, I hang up without a word.  If it's one of those individual dialers who try to fool me into thinking they know the eponymous company owner/CEO (because they read the company name somewhere), I usually get hung up on and called again several times before I can ask in a civil tone that they never call again and explain that the CEO never picks up a call from a party he doesn't know.

The thing is, I only visit once a week and Jane always holds that over Johns head. He has tried to pay her rent several times and each time Jane refuses but then tries to control him by saying \"no you can\\'t do this/have your girlfriend visit because you don\\'t pay any rent\". He always pays utilities though. Jane has also told John multiple times that she doesn\\'t mind that he stay longer despite the initial agreement only being for a month. \\n\\n\\nEvery time Jane does something bad she apologises later and says she knows she\\'s being unreasonable but then she goes and does it again. \\n\\n\\nJohn has been applying for new houses every day but been unsuccessful because our city has a huge housing crisis. Jane is still insisting that it\\'s fine that he stay with her until then and that it\\'s okay if I visit once a week (she always says it\\'s fine but complains later, saying that she hates my laugh or she wanted space). \\n\\n\\nAfter this, I never ask to visit John unless John and Jane ask me. I have never been anything but polite to Jane\\'s face (although I\\'ve told John I can\\'t understand why he wants to be friends with someone who controls him when he\\'s 27) and everytime I come over I smile genuinely and greet her but now neither of us bother with conversation. \\n\\n\\n**I\\'m NOT after a solution (obviously he needs to move out or I need to stop visiting when she says it\\'s okay), I just want to know if I\\'m an asshole for not bothering to try and make things up to Jane when it\\'s only been a measly month, considering he still wants to stay friends with her (everyone says she has a really nice side that I haven\\'t seen) and I think girlfriends should always make an effort to be nice to people their boyfriends care about.**\\n\\nJohns abusive ex refused to meet his friends and family. When she finally met his friends at a work function she left without telling him because she was bored. He was humiliated. A year later she finally met his mother and constantly complained about how she was forced to be there and even left early alone to catch a 2hr bus to the airport to get home - they were only visiting for two days. I\\'m trying to help John to a better place after the shit his ex did and I\\'m worried that by giving up with Jane I am being like his ex.

I made friends with a guy at the beginning of freshman year, we bonded over video games and such. He started to become creepy obsessed. he would text me constantly even if I didn't reply, ask where I was if i didn't already tell him. He told me he had some issues with people leaving him, so I promised I wouldn't so long as he didn't turn into a total dick. He did. \\n\\nI had a boyfriend at first but we broke up and I finally came out that I was single. about a week later I guess he was going to ask me out. (wouldn't have said yes.) a guy that bullied him in middle school I guess beat him to it. I said yes to that guy. well this creepy obsessive guy (let's call him J) got so pissed off that he threw his backpack at a school computer. he got upset at me for saying yes and tried to convince me that my new boyfriend (let's call him D) didn't actually care and just wanted me for bragging rights. J got so weird that I began to ignore him, he would walk around school and stare at me, no matter where I was. His eyes followed me like one of those creepy paintings you see in museums. After I felt I got my space, I began to try and talk to him again because I felt obligated to, I promised I wouldn't leave. \\n\\nThere was about a 6 month gap that I didn't talk to J. We starred talking more and more and one day he asked to see my tits. I said no, told him to fuck off and to not talk to me again. of course he tried to say it was a test but I just ignored him from then on. He tried to spit on me once, I ignored him then too. He started sending me emails telling me that I was the reason he was suicidal, that I should just die and that no one would miss me. I blocked him. well a few months ago he punched me. I pressed charges and now he is in anger management. \\n\\nWell Since then, D and I broke up (we were together for about a year and three months) and now he is asking all of my friends if I ever had sex with D or if I have a boyfriend and said he misses the old me. he said I used to be bubbly and apparently kinda slutty. (TOTALLY DISAGREE) and the found out that we at least fooled around (not all the way) and then called me slutty for doing stuff with D. that's not slutty, right? We were together for a long time, especially for high school. He started saying all these things like we were friends and that everything was okay now since I'm single. I told him to fuck off. \\n\\nI have enough drama at home and I don't need it at school. here's the kicker- He has a prosthetic leg. I had a dream that I went mortal combat on his ass and beat him with it. I told him that. He has pissed me off for so long and tells people that I hate him for no reason and plays the victim for all of it. there are people I don't know that call me a bitch for being this way. I don't know, I feel like I've dealt with it fairly well until threatening to go mortal combat on his ass. But now he keeps telling people he still has a huge crush on me and acts like there's nothing wrong.

He's sort of peering at us in a sort of *damned teenagers* sort of way.\\n\\n\\nI had my bike on me, so I let my friend pull the first gate open. I pushed my bike across the track, and waited for my friend to open the second gate for me.

I turned back to push my bike of the crossing and...\\n\\n'Hey, GET OFF THE TRACKS!'\\n\\nIt was the guy in the van. He proper screamed it too, like he was nurturing some kind of righteous wrathful flame; like we had killed someone he loved.

I'm a young person, and my friends and I aren't exactly the smartest-looking group (or should I say the most wealthy-looking... you get the image I'm building here). We get bad looks, we've had people threatening to call the police to kick us out of parks. It's mostly undeserved, and I'll admit I've had to apologise for being too boisterous or loud to a couple of upset parents. But this. Fucking. Guy. Was watching us through his little van window, probably stopwatch in hand, waiting for one of us to simply hesitate on these very empty, very safe railway tracks for two seconds, getting figuartively chubby at the thought of rightfully screaming at a bunch of low-down scum. I bet it made him feel very law-abiding and contributive (contribatory? contributa-tative? contribulory?) to the wellbeing of society to poke his head out of his company van, have a go, and smugly roll his window back up.\\n\\nSo basically... I got a little mad, I threw some nasty insults around. Half of my mates are reacting typically - 'woooo you showed him... awesome'. The other half are making me feel kind of bad about it - 'he's just doing his job... maybe he saw someone get hit by a train and honestly cares about us'. I'm so mad at the latter group; I think the guy's anger wasn't necessary and was unprofessional. But anyway, that's why I'm here. What do you think?\\n\\nEDIT: There was no train coming.

We all work monday to friday, 09:00 to 17:30. A housemate of mine decided at 22:45 that she wanted to use the tumble dryer, as I was climbing into bed. I got up and the conversation went something like this:\\n\\n*For further clarification, the house we live in is shit. The tumble dryer is located on top of the washing machine, and no matter how hard we try, the thing will rattle and push itself up against the wall outside my door, and shake into the wall constantly until it is finished. Myself and one other person live on the bottom floor, the other 4 people live upstairs.*  \\n\\n**Me:** \"Hey, please can you use the tumble dryer in the morning so that I can sleep now.\"  \\n**Upstairs room-mate:** \"I can\\'t CIDC, as I need dry underwear for tomorrow morning at work.\"  \\n**Me:** \"Well I need sleep. Can you put the underwear you need dried out to air tonight, and then use the tumble dryer in the morning? It\\'ll be dry by the morning.\"  \\n**Upstairs room-mate:** \"No, it needs to be dried in this tumble dryer.\"  \\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\n\\nSo she proceeds to start it for 50 minutes, and goes upstairs. I turn it off as soon as she leaves, and get back into bed. A minute or so later, I hear her come down and start it again. I go outside and so begins the argument where she says that I can keep turning it off, but she will continue to turn it on again. Eventually, I decide to just let her win and I lay awake for the entire time the dryer is banging against my wall. \\n\\nCut to 6.30am, and I hear her come downstairs and run the machine AGAIN for another half an hour. Now I\\'m completely sure this was out of spite. I get up, go to turn off the dryer and suddenly a great idea comes to me. I locate the fuse box in the house and flick the switch which controlled the power to the sockets. I went back to sleep peacefully, to the sounds of her trying to find out why her spin stopped.\\nPlease note, the fuse-box switches did not affect the fridge and freezer or such, I checked before going back to bed.\\n\\nAm I the asshole?', 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA for making somebody go to work the next day with wet clothes, so that I could sleep?', 'url': 'http://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/34dqkn/aita_for_making_somebody_go_to_work_the_next_day/'}, {'author': 'catSaysMeh', 'author_created_utc': 1360864038, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'author_fullname': 't2_all4e', 'created_utc': 1430566239, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/34m464/aita_for_getting_new_piercings_despite_the_fact/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '34m464', 'is_self': True, 'link_flair_css_class': 'not', 'link_flair_text': 'not the asshole', 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 28, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/34m464/aita_for_getting_new_piercings_despite_the_fact/', 'retrieved_on': 1440759232, 'score': 25, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': 'My boyfriend is a great guy, but he doesn\\'t like piercings or tattoos at all.

I wasn\\'t really in  the mood for a discussion, so i just let it go.\\n\\nA few months later I finally decided to get the piercings done anyway and asked two of my friends to go to a piercer with me. The night before getting pierced I gave my boyfriend - who was in London for a language training week at that time - a heads up via WhatsApp. I knew he wasn\\'t going to be thrilled, but his only response was along the lines of \"Well... if you think you\\'ll look prettier :)\" Suprisingly positive, so I figured he\\'d be okay with it.

He didn\\'t comment on them at all though, so I figured they didn\\'t bother him too much. Turns out he didn\\'t even notice them...\\n\\nFast forward a week: my boyfriend is staying at my place. I notice him staring at my new piercings. \"What the hell is that? Are those the new piercings? Why?\" and a few minutes later \"I can\\'t even tell you how much I don\\'t like them\" He\\'s devastated. And I mean literally. He pleaded with me to take them out for about 10 minutes, after I refused he proceeded to sulk for good 30 minutes. I asked him why he didn\\'t object before I got my piercings done, since if I took them out now the money I paid for them and the pain of a needle piercing through my ear would all have been for nothing. His response was \"Well, I was in London at that time...\"\\n\\nWhatever... I figured I\\'d just keep my hair down when he was aroud now, because if he can\\'t see the piercings he\\'s not going to complain about them, right? Well, not really... It worked for a while, but we were cuddling this morning and he pressed his head against my ear unintentionally. I said \"Ouch, you touched my piercings\" which sent him in sulk mode all over again.

Myself and 3 friends went and toured the place and it was pretty fantastic, so we all signed a lease. We asked a lot of questions along the way like what kind of appliances, upgrades, etc. The collected info was that: upgraded apartments come with fridge w/ice maker, surface stoves, track lighting, updated bathrooms, plank flooring, and I think that\\'s it. They waived our application fees, and let my friend and I split a $600 pet fee/deposit since we have two small pets (two 15lb dogs) making it $300 per person in pet fee/deposit. We move in in May! (except for one guy, he moves in August) w/ rent @ $409 a month.\\n\\nJanuary rolls around and I went ahead and paid $1936 (4 months rent plus pet fee/deposit) in advance for May through August. About a month before we were supposed to move in, I called to ask what apartment number I was supposed to go, or when that info would be available for us. They said they\\'d call and let us know about 2 weeks before move in. All righty! Two weeks before move in I call and say hey, we were wondering if you guys knew which apartment number yet and this person said well, we will just tell you what apartment you have when you get here, we don\\'t normally call people and tell them two weeks in advance.\\n\\nI kind of start to get annoyed here, but it\\'s not bad by any means. It\\'s just I\\'m not going to move somewhere without knowing what apartment number beforehand. What if I was moving a considerable distance? What if I get there and they forgot? It just didn\\'t seem okay to me, but maybe I was being picky/bitchy about it. My friend called back and asked the same thing, this time finding out we could fill out a maintenance request and find out. \\n\\nAbout 2 days later we find the apartment number out, so my friend and I go there and find the building, walk around etc to check it out. The door was open because they had just painted/were working on the apartment so we peeked in but din\\'t walk in. The floors were pretty dirty, and the stove was yellowed-old. We were kind of upset, but I told my friend ya know maintenance is clearly still working on this place so let\\'s wait till we move in before we get upset about anything over nothing. The next day another one of our friends says hey, the door is unlocked so I went and checked it out-- so naturally I went and checked it out too but I only had about 5 minutes and my main focus was bedrooms (we hadn\\'t picked yet). They had replaced the stove but it was still an older model (looks pretty much new but the lettering is worn off the burner knobs and it\\'s a much older model of stove with no clock or timer etc). I didn\\'t notice much else about the apartment, it was towards the end of the day with low light and like say I was in a rush. Again, I\\'m thinking they\\'ve still got 2-3 days before we move in so we\\'ll wait and see.\\n\\nThey call us the day before we move in at like 6PM and say hey, you\\'re going to have to wait until 1PM to move in so maintenance can do one last check over on the apartment. I mean, you guys are kind of taking half a day away from me but if maintenance is working hard to make sure that bitch is right, so be it, I understand. May is a weird time of year to move in college students.\\n\\nWe get there next day, get our keys, and start moving in. The place wasn\\'t really... fully cleaned. There are paint spots and scuffs all over the flooring, dust and shit-- we\\'re going to have to totally clean the floors. No icemaker in the fridge, porch light doesn\\'t work, one of the bathroom light switches doesn\\'t work, an air vent is really loose (And it\\'s right above a desk so like, it\\'s pretty dangerous), and the only upgrade here is the flooring really. Like, what the hell? The door to the bedroom I wanted is locked, so we go back to the office and ask if we can get it unlocked and they say yeah, maintenance will come by sometime today to get it. Well I mean fuck, I already had to wait till 1PM and I\\'m really pissed off at this point. I go back and talk to my mom about it, my concern being that I might just be super bitchy/nitpicky because I\\'m pretty stressed over finals and she\\'s like fuck no let me go talk to them. My mom is really loud and firm. It\\'s super intimidating and she comes off like a total bitch if you don\\'t know her.\\n\\nWe go down to the office again and she\\'s like \"Yeah, I wanna speak to a manager now.\" Meantime, another friend is there getting her keys to the new apartment as well. The property manager comes out and starts asking whats wrong and my mom starts forcefully explaining. At the same time, there\\'s confusion for my friend getting the keys, she is the roommate that also has a dog so when she goes to write a check for first months rent they are like \"yeah, the pet fee is $600\" and we explained that the property manager let us half it. We find out then that the property manager that signed us on has been fired, and left no record of that agreement (Our lease was supposed to be changed to reflect that but it never was). The new property manager says she will \"honor the agreement\" though I didn\\'t think that was a very big deal considering that was what was supposed to happen anyways-- you\\'re not exactly doing me a favor here lady (and remember, I\\'ve already paid this pet fee/deposit so I have a receipt to prove it not to mention like 5 witnesses on the verbal agreement). The new property manager comes down with us to the apartment to check out all the issues. As soon as she walks in she says \"Ohhh, this is a partially upgraded unit.\" We start feeling a lot better because it\\'s like oh all right, so it\\'s not that no one gave a shit, it\\'s just the wrong type of apartment (there was no previous mention of partially upgraded apartments, and still isn\\'t on their official paperwork. We asked for the fully upgraded model so it\\'d be just like the one we toured because we really liked it). She says she will lets us have this apartment at a regular apartment rate of $384 per month to make up for it (so $25/month less but we get upgraded flooring) plus she will help us make sure everything is fixed, etc. We all reluctantly agree (super tired from moving, it\\'s finals week, and I\\'m sick) that something like that will probably work since none of us want to move again.\\n\\nThat night we go check out a friends apartment (same apartment complex) and they have the true regular apartment. It\\'s the same price $384/month but doesn\\'t have the upgraded flooring and thats literally it. though, they have cushioned bar chairs which we would really like (ours aren\\'t cushioned) since we plan on using the bar a lot. The condition otherwise is about the same, but again, our upgraded floors are dirty, covered in paint speckles, and scuffed quite a bit.\\n\\nWe continue moving and find other details like one of the bedroom doors is totally broken and doesn\\'t shut/wiggles like a pool noodle, the freshly painted walls were painted pretty lazily (you can tell they just painted over dust etc, marks on walls, dent/scuffs here and there-- not bad looking walls by any means though). After a night\\'s sleep, we get up saturday and start moving lots of shit, and got a lot done. Feeling a bit better about it all, we get another nights rest and we are all feeling really good about it Sunday. Friends are heading back to work/studying for finals and I start unpacking my room. I quickly discover the internet absolutely sucks. It\\'s included with the apartment but their website literally says \"Fastest Internet In \"the city\" Has Just Landed At \"the apartment complex\" \" so when I run speed test and pull a sweet, savory 6 Mbps (my max rated speed, with intermittent 100Mbps \"boosts\" as needed) I\\'m more than pissed off. I\\'m ready to break my lease pissed off. It\\'s physically impossible to watch 1080p video continuously with this connection. I\\'m an electrical engineering student and do a LOT on my computer, I had hoped on living here for the next 2-4 years and I literally/physically can\\'t with internet like that. We debate looking at buying an internet package through comcast or something and splitting it but agree if we have to do that we will be demanding a deduction from our rent since we aren\\'t using their internet because it\\'s literally unbearable. However, I note to everyone that I\\'m super pissed and tired and probably much more bitchy than I should be about it all. I made a list of everything that needed to be fixed, that we were promised, and how we felt about it all together so I could go talk to the property manager today (we haven\\'t worked out resigning the leases yet so I needed to stop by anyways).\\n\\nThis morning, I felt all right. Still pretty upset over the internet, but overall decent. I head down to the office planning on having a 10-15 minute chat with the manager about all our things and it ends up being more like 2 minutes. She tells me I\\'ll have to do a maintenance request on all the broken things in the apartment, we can\\'t do anything about the internet, we can\\'t switch out our bar chairs and we they\\'ll remake the lease and we can come sign it at our convenience. Now, the internet is much better today so I don\\'t feel nearly as bad, and if it stays this good I\\'ll be happy but other residents are saying it\\'s pretty much shit all the time. Honestly, here\\'s how we felt:\\n\\n* There\\'s a new property manager, the other one got fired for whatever bad thing, and May is a weird time for us to move in, we get that.\\n\\nHowever...\\n\\n* This apartment is not what we signed a lease for, not fully cleaned, clearly not checked over (it feels like they forgot we were moving in to be honest and just threw some shit together) and there are a lot of little things adding on to the pile of disappointment and frustration.\\n\\nAs far as we\\'re concerned, this apartment complex has broken this lease with us, and that\\'s rude/insulting/maybe illegal and wants us to just accept the apartment at a slightly lower price and be quiet about it like we owe them something. We feel like they need to make it up to us more than that. I\\'ll be honest, we like the apartment pretty well. I mean for $384 a month, it\\'s pretty bitchin\\'. Though, there is an almost identical apartment literally a mile away (their main competitor) that has the same pricing and amenities but they are brand new (though they don\\'t allow pets, which sucks). But even if we wanted to go there we can\\'t now, because we expected this apartment to work out (not to mention tired from moving, finals, sick, etc as well as most apartments have their leases filled out now). So ultimately, we\\'re fucking stuck here.\\n\\nTyping this out has been really helpful for me, I think, just to lay it all out somewhere and especially if anyone care to read through this huge fuckin\\' wall of text and give me your much valued opinion.\\n\\nAt this point we\\'d feel fantastic about it all if they:\\n\\n* Fix the broken shit (this has to fucking happen)\\n* Pay to have these floors cleaned (I\\'m pretty firm on this happening)\\n* Switch the bar stools we want (I\\'m pretty firm on this happening)\\n* Updated stove (This would be nice, though the stove is already nice so it\\'s not a huge deal)\\n* Do something about the slow internet (whether it be let us get our own and deduct from our rent or upgrade the existing Pavlov shit)\\n\\nWe feel like this isn\\'t really too unreasonable, things considering, but I would love to see other people\\'s opinion before I send my property manager an email about it. I haven\\'t gone over this for clarity/typos, so apologies for that.

He didn’t want to so I apologised and went back to the living room.  I was actually a little annoyed by the whole situation, but  kept it to myself. Later in the car my wife voiced her opinion to me that she didn’t appreciate my reaction in front of the whole family. A small argument over the semantics of the exact wording of the situation ensued. Her basic point is that I should have been more pleasant in the situation and not made a fuss, my point was that I thought it was rude that she said I stole her chair when in fact I didn’t, I thought a more apt statement would have been ‘hey I missed out on a chair now’.\\n\\n\\nWas I wrong to feel it was rude of her to blame me for losing a chair? I’m at a loss to how I could have handled the situation any differently. Perhaps it would have been better to offer her my chair and apologise?

I am a 22yr old male about to graduate college. This happened yesterday, mothers day, at work. I work at a restaurant in downtown chicago, and for those of you who don\\'t know, mothers day is our second busiest day of the year, so I already wasn\\'t in the best mood.  \\n\\nI work with my roommate and my girlfriend, me and my roommate work in the same section, and my girlfriend works as a hostess on the other side of the restaurant. There are 3 other important people in this story, coworker 1 (C1), coworker 2 (C2), and chef. \\n\\n\\nSo now to actually start the story. It was a hectic day at work and we had two new people working, which just made matters worse. When I first showed up I saw my roommate and gf whispering to each other, saying something like \"did you tell him yet?\". Me, knowing they were talking about me, asked them what they were talking about, and they just changed the subject. This happened about 1-2 more times that day, but I just kicked it to the back of my mind, as that day was very busy\\n\\n I could go into all the garbage I went through at work that day, but I will skip it to be concise. Basically, I wasn\\'t in the best of moods at this time, but things were dying down and I was looking forward to leaving. I went in the back, and C1, my roommate, and the chef were all laughing in the back. When C1 saw me he shouted \"dumbass got her pregnant!\" my roommate then told him \"no she didn\\'t tell him yet!\" At this point I was beginning to get flustered, and the chef and C1 were telling me what I should have done not to get my girlfriend pregnant, with C1 telling me what a big mistake it was when he had a baby at my age.\\n\\nThey continued to grill me, but I just stood there and took it, as there was someone up front I was helping get food for. I went back up front and took care of the customer, and my mind started racing with thoughts. Is she really pregnant? Why did she tell everyone else first? Needless to say, I start to freak out a bit. The only time me and her had talked about kids is when we talked about how much we don\\'t like and don\\'t want them. So I called her over, and the conversation went like this.\\n\\nMe: \"So people have been saying some things about you, is there anything you need to tell me?\"\\n\\nHer: \"Maybe\"\\n\\n*At this point my heart starts pounding, this isn\\'t looking good*\\n\\nMe: \"well what does that mean? If you have something to tell me you can just tell me\"\\n\\nHer: \"not at work\"\\n\\n*I\\'m starting to freak the fuck out, the only reason she wouldn\\'t want to tell me at work is if it was something serious.* \\n\\nMe: \"does it have to do with\" *points to uterus*\\n\\nHer: \"yes\"\\n\\n*my eyes grow wide, my hands start shaking, I feel like I\\'m about to have a panic attack*\\n\\nMe: \"are you pregnant?\"\\n\\nHer: \" yes, I\\'m pregnant\"\\n\\nI take a step back, as my brain starts to process the gravity of what she just said. I feel the adrenaline kicking through my body, I have no idea how to respond. I\\'m staring at her wide-eyed, when my roommate jumps out from behind the door, and they both scream\" surprise!\". This does not help with my anxiety, as my heart beats faster. My gf then says \" just kidding I wasn\\'t really pregnant!\". My roommate \"yeah we got you!\". My mouth is open, blood is kicking and I cannot make words come out of my mouth. I say,\"I need to be alone right now\". I then go to the bathroom to try and calm down, be alone, and process. This feels like the start to a panic attack, but I calm myself down a little bit and go back up front. \\n\\nThere was a customer up there looking to place an order and throughout the conversation my words aren\\'t coming out right, and I\\'m still flustered. When I hand him my pen to sign the check, I bump into him  because I can\\'t controll my hand. I am obviously not calmed down yet. I go to the back and my roommate attacks me. \"Why are you being so weird?\", \"you should have known it was just a joke\", \"quit being a bitch\". To which I respond shut the fuck up, don\\'t tell me how to feel, and you almost gave me a panic attack. He keeps trying to get in my face to force me to calm down, which was making me even more upset, and I tell him to watch upfront because I need to be alone right now, and cool off.\\n\\nAs I am going towards the bathroom again, my girlfriend intercepts me. \"Did I ever tell you how much I adore you?\" I can still feel the adrenaline pumping through me, and I just stare at her. She goes in to hug me and I am still freaking out, but I try to hug her back, which turns into a weird half hug.

My mother takes a while to respond, (This is very typical behavior for her, and shes done this her whole life) and during this non-response period my sister storms out of the room saying, \"Or you could just ignore me, you know.\" So my mom slowly but surely gets up and goes into the kitchen while my sister is digging through the cabinet for pasta. At this point I start thinking about interjecting, so after 30 seconds of thought I conclude, \"That\\'s my mom, I can\\'t let her be talked to like that.\" So I get up, go to the kitchen, go up to my sister, and say to her these words. \"That was rude.\" She then turns to me and says, \"Fuck this, I\\'m going to my room, you can kiss my ass!\" At this point, I know for a fact shes the bad guy here, but what I want to know is if my reaction changed that. I turn to her while I\\'m leaving and I say, \"Don\\'t you ever talk to mom like that again, you fucking bitch! You can say whatever the fuck you want to me, but don\\'t act like that towards mom!\" I\\'d like to note, we\\'re both in college, and shes not typically like this towards my mom, I\\'m usually on the receiving end of it, so I don\\'t really tend to react. I know for a fact shes on some sort of medication to control this kind of behavior, and who knows whether or not shes had it today. But I start thinking about those things as I\\'m standing around the kitchen fuming, and my mom says to me \"Its okay, everything will be fine. She was starting to sound embarrassed about that outburst before you came in.\" So of course at this point I\\'m feeling kind of embarrassed about the whole thing like I\\'m some kind of white knight loser. So I decide to go up to her and apologize. I go up to her and do this, but she immediately becomes hostile again the conversation follows, \"If you ever threaten me again, I\\'m going to kill you.\" \"When did I threaten you?\" \"You said If you ever hear me talk to mom like that you\\'re going to kill me.\" \"I never said that.\" \"Well I\\'ll accept you apology (done in a very snide way) but remember, I\\'ll kill you.\" These threats coming from her mean almost nothing to me, I\\'d never hit her, and I don\\'t think she\\'d have the nerve to hit me.

I have mostly been camped out on the couch. Normally, I am working and my boyfriend has plenty of time alone to masturbate, and I have recently been privy to his habits a little more than I\\'m used to. I try to be understanding, since I am currently unable to have sex until six weeks postpartum. I am not against masturbation in any way - I masturbate and think it\\'s healthy. I am, unfortunately, slightly bothered by porn use. I don\\'t like to admit it, but it does irk me a little when I know he\\'s whacking it to porn (he gets up in the middle of the night to do it). I have never said anything about it in the past, because I know guys are visual and masturbation is a different, more personal thing than having sex with your partner. He has a very high sex drive. I have also tried to continue being intimate with him and have given him a few blow jobs, maybe two a week or so, since coming home from the hospital. We normally have sex nearly every day. I am exhausted as well as sexually frustrated.\\n\\nThis morning I had to take the baby to the doctor. He knew this, but he was unsure of the time I was leaving. I was nursing her on the couch and he came out of the bedroom to get the laptop and went back into the bedroom, announcing that he was going to masturbate. This bothered me and I said in a frustrated tone, \"I\\'m leaving in an hour!\" thinking he could just wait until I left, which would be preferable for me because I don\\'t really like sitting in the adjacent room awake while he masturbates, but also, I thought, to him, because he wouldn\\'t have to feel bad about me sitting out there, he could have the sound on, or whatever.\\n\\nHe gets upset and I get upset back. I said, angrily, that he could just wait for me to leave and have time to masturbate to his favorite porn star all day! We argue and I leave, and I\\'ve been stewing all day about how selfish and insensitive he is. I say that he can be more sensitive to how I feel about him masturbating whenever and wherever since I am sexually frustrated and exhausted taking care of a baby and he says I have no right to tell him when or where to masturbate or what to do with his body. \\n\\nHe is also stuck on the fact that I don\\'t like porn and is now saying I don\\'t want him to masturbate ever, which isn\\'t true. He says I can\\'t say I don\\'t want him to masturbate in the room next to me while I\\'m awake and then also say I\\'m okay with masturbation. He also says since I\\'ve never said anything about him masturbating to porn bothering me before that I am a liar and have not been upfront in our relationship. In reality, I have asked him to clear the history because I don\\'t like to see what he masturbates to. I feel my dislike of porn use is irrational, so mostly I ignore it. I have never told him not to use porn and don\\'t expect that from him at all... I just don\\'t like thinking about him jerking it in the room next to me while I\\'m sitting there!\\n\\nHopefully this makes some sense - I probably rambled a little too much.

I\\'ve been there 5 years and I cover not only my own job description but a myriad of other duties that I\\'ve taken over that fall outside my department, and I report to my mother a lot of the time- so although I answer to my manager as far as our department is concerned, I\\'m not just an employee, if that makes sense.\\n\\nMy manager has only been at the company for 6 months. She\\'s a nice enough lady, but she\\'s very distracting. We have a policy against personal phone calls unless its necessary- that\\'s what your breaks are for. Texting isn\\'t a problem as long as work is finished, because it isn\\'t distracting to everyone else like chatting at your desk tends to be. The problem is my manager easily takes 3 or 4 (sometimes more) personal phone calls a day. It\\'s not just quick questions either- the shortest are 2 or 3 full minutes and there have been times where it has been up to 15. There are only 3 people in my department, so we\\'re all in the same office. As such her phone calls get very, very distracting. Hearing it pulls me right out of whatever I\\'m doing, especially when it\\'s mundane bullshit about dinner plans. Conversely, I VERY rarely take calls at the office and the few times I have to, I leave the room. It seems disrespectful and unprofessional to me to subject people to my personal life.

I explained that I find it difficult to concentrate with chatter. Regardless of the policy we have I don\\'t care what she does or how often she takes calls- I just have a lot of work to do and it makes it harder to focus hearing her go on and on. She said \"What, so all I\\'m allowed to do in here is work? Is that what you\\'re telling me?\" and got really defensive about it. I tried explaining that it\\'s just too distracting, but she got passive-aggressive about it and we didn\\'t get anywhere. When I said good night before leaving, she didn\\'t say a word to me.

For clarity we\\'ll call the ex \"John\" and the girlfriend \"Jane\". \\n\\nSo it\\'s around 1 AM on March 30th(technically April 1st by then), John has started talking to me of all people about how he still has feelings for her and he explains to me in the most sincere and apologetic and overall nicest way you could imagine that he thinks Jane has feelings for him too, and he\\'s worried about things happening because he doesn\\'t want to \\'betray\\' me. \\n\\nNo problems there, I, as I think would be reasonable in the situation get a bit sad and worried as I already had some kinda large problems with worrying about losing Jane. I don\\'t want to get too involved so I tell Jane I feel upset for no real reason and she understands and tries to help me feel better. \\n\\nOver the few hours this sadness increases as I get more and more worried of the idea of things going more than a bit bad for me. John eventually reveals the information that he wants Jane and him to share a bed. I don\\'t want to get annoyed at him for risk of making things worse, so I try to encourage him to reconsider. \\n\\nAt around 3:30 AM, he stops responding for about 20 minutes. I ask him why he\\'s AFK. He responds with the message: \"APRIL FOOOLS LOLOLOL\". \\n\\nI call him a cunt and go to sleep feeling more than slightly betrayed and tricked. No problems there. I talk to Jane about what happened, she says she knows.\\n\\nWait - how could she have known? Oh yes, because none other than my most trusted companion was in on it. More than this, she suggested it. This doesn\\'t make me angry or annoyed, this just makes me really fuckin sad. So I take a day off my computer and sleep the rest of the day.\\n\\nOver a month later I still feel upset when speaking to John and I cant help but forget the April Fools joke.

Over the last few year she has been getting into modelling, doing various photoshoots. I've always tried to support her as much as I can (I always come along with her to shoots, I don't have any issues with her being naked etc).  \\n  \\nRecently, a photographer from Spain got in touch with her and said that he'd like to work with her. He's a retired British male who frequently works with models from the UK - he says that as long as she pays for the flights he's happy to provide her with accommodation and food for the weekend, in exchange for a photoshoot and her posing for his life drawing class.  \\n  \\nShe mentioned that she'd feel better if I could come along too, which the photographer said was fine. However, I said I had reservations staying with somebody that we didn't know in a foreign country. We argued about it a bit but eventually agreed to go along but to stay in a hotel.  \\n  \\nToday we booked our flights, and we're not going to be arriving until after midnight. The photographer has offered to pick us up straight from the airport and drop us at our hotel - again, I had some reservations about this. I explained that I don't see why this guy is going above and beyond, offering us accommodation and rides when she's only doing a few hours work for him over the weekend (which she is also getting paid for).  \\n  \\nHer argument is that he's just being professional - he's married and has a reliable web presence (he does look to be a good photographer and he's got testimonials from female models who have gone alone to stay with him and his wife). She points out that if he was up to anything dodgy, why would he go to the trouble of coaxing someone over from the UK, when friends and family are going to know where they are? She claims that I'm overthinking and worrying too much and that I need to loosen up.  \\n  \\nI can see her side but I'm very reluctant to trust this guy. To me it seems like he's trying way to hard to have contact with us outside of the proposed work - I've said that I'm still happy to go but we should definitely keep contact with him limited to the work (for example, sort our own airport transfers and not go to his house).  She keeps asking me what I think he's going to do, and I guess I can't really provide a clear answer - it's just in my nature not to trust a stranger, especially within an industry like modelling which I argued is notorious for exploitation. Also I think the fact he has a good reputation on a few websites is pretty much meaningless. \\n  \\nWhat do you guys think? Do I need to loosen up a little or am I right not to trust someone we've never met?\\n     \\n**Tl;dr:** girlfriend is an amateur model and a foreign guy we've never met has offered her a photoshoot.

What I want to know is what others have to say about this whole situation. I\\'ve never had any real bouts with family so, I\\'m feeling a bit caught off guard about all of this, if nothing else.\\n\\nSo here\\'s what happened:\\n\\nMy Grandpa passed away recently (early April), relatively unexpectedly and tragically. I booked an emergency flight home from abroad as soon as I had news about funeral arrangements. I was home for about a week, just enough time to get settled in at home, be there for the funeral and spend sometime with family. Even though I had just been back in the States two weeks prior for a planned visit, original plans were suddenly changed with the deterioration in my grandpas health, landing him in the hospital twice in the last week and a half.\\n\\nLet me back up in potential build-up of drama by stating the following:\\n\\nOnce the news of his death came to me, having waited overnight, not to mention giving myself a chance to calm down as the news was hard to take as I was very close to my Grandpa, and he was my last grandparent, I changed my Facebook profile to the original picture of a 1952 portrait of my grandparents I have tattooed on my shoulder blade. I also changed my profile banner to a picture of my Grandpa with two of my favorite cousins and I during the last time I was in Georgia with my family (2008, the spring after my Grandma, his wife, has passed from Alzheimer\\'s). Going to GA for Easter used to be a family tradition up until I\\'d say the last 12 years ago or so. Since then, it has become much more sporadic because of my Grandparents health slowly deteriorating as they aged (and public schools spring break not lining up with Easter any more).\\n\\nAnyway, moving on: shortly after changing my pictures, my aunt Tami (married to my Mom\\'s brother), sent me a message that said \"OP:... My son doesn\\'t know yet.\" To which I asked if she wanted me to change them. She said yes. I didn\\'t.\\n\\nInstead, I replied that I didn\\'t see what the problem was. I didn\\'t post a status / any words about what had happened. I simply changed my pictures. I also noted that I wasn\\'t even friends with her son on FB. She retaliated that there was still GA family that didn\\'t know about what had happened and that FB wasn\\'t the place for them to find out. I agreed, but reaffirmed that I only changed my pictures specifically for that reason. *No further correspondence.*\\n\\nThe weekend after the funeral, the family began work on Grandpas house to get it ready to put up for sale on the open market. As we began to start clearing it out for renovations, the majority of the family was there making piles of trash, donation, and keep. Having recently moved 4,000+ miles away to Germany, I opted not to keep much of anything save for a few sentimental items:\\n* Good Housekeeping cookbook 1969 (containing a few recipies I knew him and Grandma used)\\n* Family Genealogy book\\n* Military uniform, ribbons and medals\\n* Letters from Grandpa to Grandma while in the AF stationed in Germany circa August - February 1952 (my other cousin, Britt, kept the remainder of the stack of letters from 1953 and 1969).\\nI wanted to keep his military photo album too, but Mom said not yet. Of the few things I kept, I went through the house checking with every member of my family that they did not want the items I wanted. I always asked my uncle Mike first, as he was the eldest remaining child. No one had any objections.\\n\\nA few days after the clean up, I left to come back to my new home across the pond. Not a week after being back, my Mom was messaging me telling me not to be surprised if Tami sends me a message asking for Grandpas military medals. Confused, she explained that Tami and her daughter Sarah, wanted to make a special memorial display of the flag presented to Mike at the funeral and include Grandpa\\'s original military medals and ribbons in his honor as a gift to Mike for Father\\'s Day.\\n\\nUpon request (and without my knowledge), my Mom told Tami that she had the medals, but that they meant a lot to me and she would check with me before letting her have them. She also suggested to get duplicate medals and ribbons from and army surplus store. Unfortunately, this solution is not favorable by the requesting party. I\\'m not sure what happened after that, but I did not receive any correspondence from Tami.\\n\\nFast-forward to just the other day:\\nMy cousin Sarah (Mike and Tami\\'s daughter), sent me a message again requesting Grandpas military medals and ribbons. She noted that her dad \"didn\\'t ask for much when we were cleaning the house since he was just trying to hold it together.\" I responded cordially stating that I think the display is a wonderful and thoughtful gift idea for her father, but that I feel it is important the original medals and ribbons stay with his original uniform. I reinforced the purchase of duplicate medals and ribbons for Mike\\'s display, as I wanted to make a shadow box display of my own showcasing Grandpas military memorabilia, and that it would look weird with new medals and an old uniform. Furthermore, I suggested incorporating his service certificates (which Mike actually *DID* want) into the display. Sarah said in her response message to me that she was, \"not trying to take Grandpas things from [me but is] trying to do something for [her] dad who\\'s having a hard time.\" I replied to her, that I only took a total of 4 items the day of the initial clean and that while she isn\\'t \"trying\" to take something from me, she *would* be taking a huge part of the 1 out of 4 things I have to remember our Grandpa by. I concluded the message by saying \"I hope you understand.\"\\n\\nHer only response: \"I don\\'t at all.\"\\n\\nA few minutes later, she posts a status that says \"Wow how my eyes have been opened over the last month and a half!\" I \"liked\" it out of irony. She immediately sends me a message that says, \"Do me a favor and don\\'t like my status. Delete me if you want. I just don\\'t care anymore.\" One of her friends commented with concern about what the status was about. She replied simply stating \"People who only think about themselves.\" Clearly, the status is about me (should I make a point here that I am considerably younger than her?).\\n\\nI didn\\'t condone her messages with a response but rather, a lack of action or response. \\n\\nWell Reddit, that\\'s what happened. No words since. I\\'m not sure how to feel about this. Mostly I want to say \"fuck it,\" but I can\\'t seem to let it go because 1) This is surprising to me and 2) Grandpa wouldn\\'t want this and it makes me sad.\\n\\nStill though, I keep having to fight the urge to say something to her \\n\\nAM I THE ASSHOLE HERE?!', 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA for Not Giving Up Grandpas Military Medals?', 'url': 'http://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/36osrm/aita_for_not_giving_up_grandpas_military_medals/'}, {'author': 'Rubykuby', 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'created_utc': 1432170169, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/36p81c/aita_for_ignoring_someone_who_texted_while_driving/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '36p81c', 'is_self': True, 'link_flair_css_class': 'not', 'link_flair_text': 'not the asshole', 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 10, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/36p81c/aita_for_ignoring_someone_who_texted_while_driving/', 'retrieved_on': 1440723586, 'score': 27, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': 'So I got into a new guild in a game.

She made it clear a number of times she wanted him to leave me and be with her, including sending him a tape of her masterbating. It was really hurtful he continued to.be her friend for so long. Nothing physical happened between the two of them, but they did hang out. On one occasion he even forgot that we were meeting for lunch because I needed help carrying a lunch tray as I was walking with crutches due to a knee injury. He went to lunch with her because she was having a bad day while I waited around like an idiot. He didn\\'t even call me, so I found this out that night when he got back from class. He said he felt bad for her because she found out she had MS and her boyfriend was a serial cheater, etc. I never told him he had to cut her out of his life because I don\\'t think it is right to dictate who he spent his time with, even though it really hurt me. He even considered having us \"take a break\" when she told him she and her boyfriend were taking a break. I told him I loved him, but if he wanted to take a break to see where things could go with another woman than I considered it a break up. I told him I wanted him to be happy, but I would not sit around and be a doormat and wait for him while he slept with someone else.I would accept decision, but if he didn\\'t chose me we were done. He chose me and eventually phased her out of his life.\\n\\n\\nI have forgiven him. We met young and he didn\\'t expect to meet someone he would be so serious with when he did. I do.understand that, but he still treated me pretty horribly and while I have tried to let it go completely, the hurt doe creep up from time to time because it was such a tough time for me and really hits a sensitive, insecure part of me.\\n\\nWe have a great life a d a great married. We even survived the loss of our oldest daughter six days after birth to trisomy 18. We have two other daughters (2.5 years old and 10 months old). I had to get a hysterectomy because of pain and issues. This has been hard on me. Now I am making ovarian cysts on the one ovary I have left. The pain, disappointment and fear is causing me a lot stress (and physical pain). I may need to have this ovary removed, which will put me into full menopause and I am only 29. I can\\'t do hormone replacement and this could shorten my life by 20 years. As we are waiting to get my prescription for pain medication and finding out I have to call my gynocologist to figure this all out, my husband goes, \"oh, hey, it was L\\'s birthday and she mentioned she is pregnant with a little boy.\" I know she has a daughter to. I just said that was nice and I hope it means her MS is under control. I meant it to because I don\\'t wish her ill. MS is a terrible thing for anyone to go through and she was young, scared and looking for a better man. What she did was wrong, but desperate people do desperate things. I can let that go.\\n\\nNow to the heart of it all. It. Bothered me that he is Facebook friends with her and knows what is going on in her life. It bothers me that he mentioned her because it feels like he brought her into our lives, even though it was something small. I was feeling nervous and in pain and he had to bring her up. It was frustrating, but I know it wasn\\'t something done to be cruel. He just saw it and mentioned it like he does with so many other things.\\n\\nI took the opportunity to try to talk with him about it last night. I don\\'t want to beat a dead horse, but when it was fresh we couldn\\'t talk about it without tears and so much pain. I was curious about a few things and asked if he would be comfortable talking about it with me. He adMota what he did in college was wrong. He hates he caused me so much pain and was ashamed he did that to me, but it was the past and he was over it. Now, I don\\'t want him to feel bad and ashamed forever, but he basically told me it doesn\\'t ever bother him anymore because he is a different man and that I helped make him that better man. I get that and appreciate that he feels that way, but it bother me a bit that he doesn\\'t feel ashamed about it at all now. It still was him who caused me that pain. I also wanted to know what it was about her than made her worth hurting me, what made him chose her over me so many times. He claimed that\\'s not what he was doing. I explained that by going out and spending time with her knowing it hurt me, he decided to put her above me, that he valued spending time with her more and I wanted to understand what made him feel she was more worth it than I was. He swears up and down it isn\\'t like that. That he doesn\\'t quantify relationships like that. I tried to explain that when he choses to do something he knew would hurt me in order to do something for someone else thst he wasn\\'t putting me first. He chose to make the other person more important. He kept insisting things don\\'t work that way. It felt like her wasn\\'t trying to see things my way and understand why it hurt as much as it did and how that insecurity is still with me today. He just kept insisting thst it wasn\\'t like that. I told him it felt like he was bringing her into our lives by mentioning her. I explained that I needed his love and support because of what is physically going in with me and mentioning someone who caused me so much pain really hurt me. He asked if I wanted him to unfriend her. I told him that I would never tell him who to associate with and that was his choice (and I mean that). It\\'s not like I think he is going to have an affair with her or that he is having long conversations with her. That said, it does hurt that he still has allowed her to be in his life, even in this incredibly minor way, because of the past history. I tried explaining that it hurt because she was a reminder of the troughest point in our relationship. He went on a rant how he never sees or talks to anyone from college. His best friend from college, who was like a brother to him, died 8 years ago from lymphoma  (we were there for him the whole time). I know it hurts him he doesn\\'t spend time with anyone else from school. We have talked about it in the past. That said, this is a person who tried to convince him to leave me for her. She actively perused him and while he didn\\'t have a physical relationship she, what he done could be seen as an emotional affair. I feel like not having any form of contact wit h her is a given. Apparently not. Hell, if he insists on being her friends for whatever resson, don\\'t talk about her to me, especially when I am suffering depression and anxiety and physical pain. I mean, if something bad happened to her and she needed help I would be more okay with that because she doesn\\'t have a lot of support. But why tell me about her life? If I had someone like that in my past (I don\\'t, because no matter how many people tried to peruse me in high school and college, and there were a few who tried, I never did anything like that to him) I would not have any contact with them at all. Hell, I avoided the guy who asked me to a school dance (in college) because he knew I had a boyfriend and was still clearly trying to make a move on me out of respect for our relationship. I don\\'t want to tell him he can\\'t talk to her at all. I do trust him. It just hurts thst he doesn\\'t even understand why this hurts me. We usually communicate very well, but it feels like he refuses to fully listen and see why this hurts me. I finally got so frustrated I told him just to forget about it. He asked this morning if I am still upset over it and I told him that I am. I am working on letting it go, but it all really hurts me, especially that he can\\'t understand why it hurts me so much.\\n\\n\\nSorry if this is long and confusing. I am.on my phone and was trying to type this out while one kid rested and the other was on the potty. \\n\\nAm I an asshole for being hurt that my husband mentioned someone who tried to steal him away in college is having another baby while we were leaving a difficult doctor\\'s appointment?', 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA for being upset that my husband was talking to me about someone who caused me a lot of pain in the past?', 'url': 'http://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/36w19c/aita_for_being_upset_that_my_husband_was_talking/'}, {'author': 'NeomerArcana', 'author_created_utc': 1316314097, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'author_fullname': 't2_5vnoe', 'created_utc': 1432361182, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/36youb/aita_for_ruining_the_only_chance_humanity_has_at/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '36youb', 'is_self': True, 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 3, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/36youb/aita_for_ruining_the_only_chance_humanity_has_at/', 'retrieved_on': 1440719108, 'score': 0, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': '', 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'default', 'title': 'AITA for ruining the only chance humanity has at survival?', 'url': 'http://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/36youb/aita_for_ruining_the_only_chance_humanity_has_at/'}, {'author': 'bmaxxx', 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'created_utc': 1432408901, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/370lsr/aita_for_wantingneeding_affection_after_sex_every/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '370lsr', 'is_self': True, 'link_flair_css_class': 'not', 'link_flair_text': 'not the asshole', 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 12, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/370lsr/aita_for_wantingneeding_affection_after_sex_every/', 'retrieved_on': 1440718215, 'score': 7, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': \"Okay so neither of us is really an asshole in this situation, but this was the best sub I could think of for some insight.   \\n\\nI'm seeing a guy.

We\\'d all been friends since elementary school, and I was elated that my new gf fit in so seamlessly with all of us. Soon after I introduced her to them, however, she started flirting with Allan. It didn\\'t faze me at first first because it seemed harmless and I thought I had nothing to worry about (obviously very wrong), but while we were together she became *very* insistent on us having a threeway with him, how it was her ultimate fantasy, all this &amp; that. I told her that I\\'d possibly open to the idea of an MMF threesome but that I\\'d want to try with an MFF first (she\\'s very sexually experienced and had already had both, whereas I was markedly less so). This always turned into a gripe about how it wasn\\'t fair, how we\\'d never find a girl, how we could just find a girl after, but I was always fairly stern on my position that I didn\\'t want to jump into something I didn\\'t feel comfy with.\\n\\nNow here\\'s the thing about Allan since shortly after I got with my gf, he\\'s moving to another province this summer. I\\'d always said I would go down and visit him the next summer after we graduate and then he could come back to Ontario with me &amp; whoever came along (usually we\\'d say it was my gf and my first best friend). But this timer really stuck with her, *\"We can just do it before he goes so we won\\'t have to deal with him after\"* or *\"We\\'re gonna lose our chance and it\\'ll be for nothing\", so she always just nailed it in because I suppose in her mind she knew eventually she\\'d run out of time.\\n\\nAfter we first got back together, it didn\\'t take her long to start bringing the threeway back up. I thought it was kind of fucked up that I\\'d just taken her back after she fucked some random dude and she was already begging me for a threesome with another guy, one of my best friends no less. I told her, and she stopped mentioning it... for a well. Eventually I just became sort of resigned to it, and foolishly one day I promised her that we could have a threeway with him before he left- still on the condition we had the MFF first. She took it gladly, but she was always trying to get me to just ignore the second part, again because it\\'d be so hard to get a girl and I \"wasn\\'t the one looking for girls\". Tbh I wasn\\'t really, a threesome sounded kind of sexy but it wasn\\'t something essential to me, I\\'d never really pushed for it or needed it and honestly I didn\\'t wanna watch the girl I loved getting railed by the guy I knew in second grade.\\n\\nSince we broke up for the last time she\\'s been with a few new guys, and it crushes me a bit each time but I make sure I never tell her not to do anything (although we\\'ve talked long and hard about why it hurts me and how she doesn\\'t mean it to). She\\'s the kind of person to whom sex is purely physical, she can fuck a person and feel no ways about it. I\\'m not, I\\'ve only had sex with two people and I was in love with both of them (vs her 45 by last count), to me sex is something you share with someone you care about; it\\'s also physical and it\\'s about pleasure sure but what would the pleasure mean if you didn\\'t care about the person you\\'re with?\\n\\nThis mentality is really whats our problem now. She still wants to fuck him, only now it\\'s not in a threesome. She\\'s told me before how she\\'s \"going to fuck him.\", she\\'s promised me that she wouldn\\'t, and then later she\\'s told me how it\\'s not fair for me to ask her not to. See, to me, it seems like I shouldn\\'t have to ask my exgf not to fuck my best friend, for every reason that jumps to most peoples mind when they read that sentence. She doesn\\'t get any of that. She flat out doesn\\'t understand why I\\'m so opposed to it. She just wants to fuck him before he moves away, and I KNOW that if I were to not say anything that she would. I wish I could say that I could trust Allan not to fuck her (like Connor says \"he knows thats against the bro code\") but I also KNOW that he would. Which I can\\'t quite blame him for, I know she\\'s suuuper hot and I wanted to fuck her too, but he also knows how much this breakup has hurt me. She wants to fuck him and then let him move away and forget about it, but everytime I think about her fucking him I can\\'t help but think that I wouldn\\'t want to be friends with her still if she did, him either.\\n\\nHer argument: sex doesn\\'t mean anything to her, it\\'s only physical, and he\\'\\'s moving away so we won\\'t have to deal with it. We\\'re not together any more, I can\\'t control her, she should be allowed to have sex with whoever she wants.\\n\\nMy argument: I don\\'t want my best friend to fuck the girl I love. I don\\'t want to be the guy who\\'s exgf fucks his friends (AGAIN- this happened last time, which I\\'ve explained to her) on top of already being cheated on.\\n\\nI see her arguments, and I\\'m not trying to restrict her from things or control her (I\\'ve **never** been the controlling type), but honestly it just seems like something I shouldn\\'t have to ask for. I can try and find some kind of place where I can\\'t help but not care that\\'s she with other people; but if I were to try and get to that place where I don\\'t care about the fact that she\\'s now fucking my friend, she\\'d have to stop being anything to me. Just before we hung up, shortly before posting this, I told her I didn\\'t want this to drive us apart (any more than we already are); she told me I\\'m the only one making it an issue.

I got on a crowded train after a long day of work and managed to get a seat which was great because I was exhausted and my bag was heavy. A teen couple gets on the train, kind of ugly, girl was a bit chubby, but I know I\\'m an asshole for saying that part.\\n\\nThey then start singing. It\\'s not just that they were singing, which would annoy the fuck out of me regardless, but they were singing HORRIBLY and loud. At first I thought they were trolling. They were so out of tune that I thought it was a joke. Like purposely sounding terrible. I soon realized that they thought they were amazing. They were legitimately complimenting each other and showing off what they could do, going all over the place with their voices, fucking up harmonies, and thinking they were killing it.\\n\\nThey continued doing this with different music theater songs for the rest of the 30-40 minute part of the ride that I was on. I wanted to say something so bad, but a few people were kind of smirking. I would make a \"holy shit this is bad\" look with my face, sort of rolling my eyes, and people noticing it would kind of smile because they knew I was right.\\n\\nI ended up not telling them to shut up. I know I could have just gone to a different cart, but the train was packed like sardines and the other one looked worse. \\n\\nAnother issue is, I\\'m a white guy, and they were both hispanic, and we were heading to a mostly hispanic area, and I didn\\'t want to be that white guy who was a dick to hispanics on a hispanic-dominated train. That might sound racist, but take it for what it is.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnyway, I really wanted to say something, I just felt like I\\'d have been an asshole to say it, even though THEY WERE TOTALLY FUCKING ASSHOLES. They also mentioned a few times that they teacher told them to practice nonstop until the show, but they decided to take it literally at everyone else\\'s expense.\\n\\nSo, would I have been the asshole to tell them to shut up? I had a strong hunch that if I asked nicely they would have just been rude about it and started singing louder and then I would have just had a fucking brain aneurysm right there on the spot. \\n\\nAlso, Can we make it okay to ask WIHBTAH?

One of my best friends has had a rough couple of years. He doesn\\'t really deal with emotions well, and has had a couple of deaths in his family, had a girlfriend who he didn\\'t feel treated him right which after the breakup practically drove him to alcoholism, and most notably 1,5 years ago found out his brother (who had 2 kids) had been beaten to the point where he\\'s pretty much dead, and since the people who did it never got caught, and his brother still breathes he hasn\\'t had any closure.\\n\\nLast summer, he met a bipolar girl, and in a few weeks they got together. She lived in a town about 80 miles from here, and they met during the weekends. After a few months when he lost his job he moved to her.\\n\\nTo sum up their relationship, he complained that she constantly made things to make him feel bad, and he said she was always bossy and stuff. She later revealed that she only did that to make him feel something, since he was living in a bubble after what happened to his brother, and all of a sudden he started feeling lots of things. Eventually, he started seeing a psychologist which made him feel better, and learn lots of things about himself.\\n\\nAfter maybe 3 months of living together, she broke up with him because she couldn\\'t stand how negative he was. He turned to alcohol and wanted to kill himself, and she got in touch with him and they worked things out and he started only seeing things positively. No negative things at all in his life, only optimism, and that can be good.\\n\\nNow to the point. She broke up with him, since apparently they were fighting constantly and she couldn\\'t take it. The following week he was actually writing to me and our buddy about wanting to kill himself, and that he drank every night to be able to sleep. We told him to stop it and move away from her ASAP, since he complained she was doing everything she could to make him feel like crap. He first said she blamed him for making her act like that since *he* was really immature, and we really told him that he should GTFO. He said he wanted to try again, but she said there was no chance they would do that. Important here is that while being sad he was complaining about her always blaming everything on him, and always bossing him around and making him feel worthless.\\n\\nThe same weekend they both got drunk and ended up in bed, and talked everything out and he understood that despite he really wanted to try again with a relationship it just wouldn\\'t happen. We said that was great and really pushed him to look for an apartment.\\n\\nA few days later he pretty much wrote *\"Well the pile of shit that is my life won\\'t get smaller. Guess who\\'s pregnant.\"*, and me and my buddy\\'s thought was of course that he didn\\'t really want a kid. We asked him how he felt about it and what they were planning on doing (keeping the kid or not), and he said he didn\\'t know, but it didn\\'t matter since it was her decision. Remember that this is in Sweden where abortion is probably more accepted among the people.\\n\\nThis is where stuff got bad. We told him that she shouldn\\'t be the one to decide over his life, and if he didn\\'t want to be a dad he shouldn\\'t have to, and if he didn\\'t want the kid the decision would be up to her, and if she wanted to keep the kid all by herself, knowing the dad wouldn\\'t be there, the kid would be her problem. We said this thinking that she was actually considering an abortion, because we felt she was running him over and wanted him to stand up and say it would be stupid to have a kid if that was what he thought. We of course pointed out that they weren\\'t in a good position to get a kid since they broke up and were never going to get together again, and because she wasn\\'t mentally healthy and he had just started to take some babysteps into becoming mentally stable it would be hard, since getting a kid can be a huge pressure and can make people depressed, and she couldn\\'t even handle him for a week acting immature without driving him to the edge of suicide.\\n\\nA few days later he wrote that he had thought about it and couldn\\'t see a single thing bad about getting a kid. Only positive things. We of course asumed she had decided they were keeping the kid, and he was just trying to make the best of it. We told him to be realistic, and that getting a kid would turn his life upside down and that he shouldn\\'t just do it because this wasn\\'t just a puppy he could give away, or an ugly tattoo he could laser away, but something permanent which could be a financially and mentally monumental challenge. We told him to think seriously about it and encouraged him that if he didn\\'t want the kid, he should tell her that, and we told him to think critically about the whole situation and not just think \"it\\'ll all work out\", since that\\'s his usual mindset which doesn\\'t really always work out.\\n\\nA few days later, he tells us we have for the final time stepped over the line and that we were horrible people who told him to rule over his girl and that if we really would do something like that to our own girlfriends we deserve to be castrated, and many more things. She wrote directly to me that she wished my mother would abort me. They said we blamed her for everything and thought it was her fault and that he should just leave her to deal with the problem on her own, and they were both furious that we even mentioned an abortion. She was adopted as a kid, and I can see her being upset about that since we\\'d basically suggest her parents should\\'ve aborted her since she apparently was an unwanted child.\\n\\nHe basically said that if we would ever see his child or him again we\\'d have to apologize for everything. I said we didn\\'t know she was so against abortions, but he was furious about us even mentioning it and just said all his other friends reacted positively when he said \"I\\'m going to be a dad\", which in my opinion is a completely different statement for them to react to. My buddy had earlier pretty much told him that if they\\'d be stupid if they kept the kid, but that was mostly a desperate attempt to get him out of his fantasy-bubble about everything just working itself out, but I can see him being pissed about that.\\n\\nI wrote endless walls of text breaking down every single word we said and explained how we thought, and I apologized for misunderstanding the situation and drawing the false conclusion that she was considering abortion when she apparently was not, but that their reaction was based on a completely different context than the one we knew about, and that based on the context we knew about we didn\\'t really say anything wrong. We might\\'ve used some harsh words and went for some hard \"brotherly love\", but we never meant any harm. He wouldn\\'t buy that, and kept saying that it was all our fault because we drew conclusions, and  that it didn\\'t matter what he had told us earlier since he was sad at that moment, but I maintained that it didn\\'t matter if he was sad because we went by the information we had and tried to support him.\\n\\nI said I won\\'t apologize if I don\\'t think I\\'ve done something wrong, and until he tells me exactly what I\\'ve done wrong and I can\\'t explain it with something else than that I was actually wrong, I won\\'t apologize. He wouldn\\'t accept that or even keep talking, but just ended the contact right there. It took more than a week of constant talking before we reached that point, and I was pretty shook up and genuinely angry with his way of dealing with it.\\n\\nHe later wrote to me in private (we had all conversation in a group chat on Facebook between me, him and our buddy) that he was most sad about losing me as a friend, and that he thought I had gotten less rational and humble than I was earlier. I replied back with a long breakdown of everything that happened, pretty much like I\\'ve done here, and he later replied that he didn\\'t really want to do this at all, but just did it because he and the girl had agreed to try to get together again in a few months and since she hated us for what we said he had to get rid of us to get back with her. He said he\\'d try to work it out with all of us later, but he\\'d have to get back with her first. \\n\\nSo, are we the assholes for asuming they were considering an abortion and maybe (probably) being biased to that outcome, or should we have just nodded and agreed to everything he said? Should we have given any advice at all or just played along? \\n\\nTL;DR: Friend in mentally bad place gets dumped by bipolar girlfriend *twice*, gets her pregnant after other breakup, he says he has nothing to say about keeping the kid or not, we say he should have the right to decide just like she does and that they\\'re in a bad place to get a kid right now, she ends up wanting me dead for suggesting an abortion and he cancels our friendship.', 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA for suggesting abortion when one of my best friends got his ex girlfriend pregnant?', 'url': 'http://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/389x03/aita_for_suggesting_abortion_when_one_of_my_best/'}, {'author': 'zjbird', 'author_created_utc': 1296861356, 'author_flair_css_class': 'badge', 'author_flair_text': 'Asshole Enthusiast', 'author_fullname': 't2_4szng', 'created_utc': 1433282500, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'edited': 1433282919, 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/38a7dt/am_i_the_asshole_for_replying_multiple_times_to_a/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '38a7dt', 'is_self': True, 'link_flair_css_class': '', 'link_flair_text': 'everyone sucks', 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 33, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/38a7dt/am_i_the_asshole_for_replying_multiple_times_to_a/', 'post_hint': 'self', 'preview': {'images': [{'id': 'CW6e3b9BFsxdK_RyyfnCZLZQoUy7JQ373CFsKpVwaPU', 'resolutions': [{'height': 59, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/N3Z-m22fPQheNO_dTPehQr6fESWTJY9ZXqjo1VqbgCw.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=64f68d515ac21286b3f1beddee6400bb', 'width': 108}, {'height': 118, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/N3Z-m22fPQheNO_dTPehQr6fESWTJY9ZXqjo1VqbgCw.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=fbdedb5b6372ea1db2277b2a9c14d9be', 'width': 216}, {'height': 175, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/N3Z-m22fPQheNO_dTPehQr6fESWTJY9ZXqjo1VqbgCw.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=c87a16650b56ae16c7d375d33e35e407', 'width': 320}, {'height': 350, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/N3Z-m22fPQheNO_dTPehQr6fESWTJY9ZXqjo1VqbgCw.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=08fc2cd26c837a6e13378a8b325eaf57', 'width': 640}, {'height': 525, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/N3Z-m22fPQheNO_dTPehQr6fESWTJY9ZXqjo1VqbgCw.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=dc3bfc44f10db42c5a4609625a1cd86d', 'width': 960}], 'source': {'height': 529, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/N3Z-m22fPQheNO_dTPehQr6fESWTJY9ZXqjo1VqbgCw.jpg?s=f0a1fdc4e9bdf3e038c4e445d55a56ba', 'width': 967}, 'variants': {}}]}, 'retrieved_on': 1440696757, 'score': 5, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': \"http://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3894fu/aitah_or_rather_wihbtah_would_i_have_been_the/crtea5t\\n\\nHe's winning over the crowd, but here's what actually happened, I replied to another comment he made in the same subreddit because I've been browsing through this subreddit.

Early on I told her that if she had been with anyone that was involved in the same sports institution as us.  Which is someone we both know and other mutual friends of ours would know.  That that would be a problem, however I would like to know before hand so that we could either deal with it appropriately or choose to not proceed.  She promised and swore and down that she hadn't.  To the point that on multiple occasions she made me feel like an asshole for ever asking.  Well fast forward three years, and it turns out she has...and with the same someone she said she hadn't.  I told her that she knowingly decieved me and lied and covered it up and that we would no longer be together.  She claims it was a drunken mistake and that she lied because she wanted to be with me and she knew telling me early on.  Would make that impossible.  Since than she has been very loyal.  This lie however is significant and makes me wonder if her excuse about being drunk and it being one time is even true.  As well as calls into question if other things she has said are lies as well.  Am I the asshole for telling her this is irreparable?\\n\\nEdit 1:  First off thank you for everyone for your replies.  The two sides of the replies is exactly how I have been going back and forth in my head.  Yes she lied yes that dishonest.  She did it to stay with me.  Yet she knew the consequences of lying.  However has been seemingly loyal while together.  It is scary to think what else she has lied about though.\\n\\nEdit 2:  For those saying it was unfair for me to ask.  Well it is a very tight knit community this place and I knew people would be talking.  I wanted to to know the character of the person I was going to be with.  And if it was a person who was into one night stands or bounced from person to person.  Well than it wasn't for me.  She made it seem like how she was being with me me was special and not common.  So I did not want to be just another guy who just happened to come along.  If she was just going down the list, well than I wasn't something special.  I was just someone who worked out.  \\n\\nEdit 3:  For those saying at least she came clean when caught.  Well not really it took someone telling me directly to my face for me  to find out.  Which coincidentally is one of the reasons I wanted to know.  If I am defending her honor when people question it by saying oh she has been with some guys and I am saying oh know never she is not like that.  Well I look like a dumb fuck.  So when i did confront she didn't fess up at first.  As always she tried to make me feel bad for listening to others and questioning her.  Something she often did as a means to cover it up.  \\n\\nEdit 5:  I will tell everyone what bothers me more than the first lie.  It's the way the second and third unfolded.  First she says oh she was out drinking and this guy who we know just called her and asked if she wanted to join him out for drinks.  So she said she went just as friends.  Now from my understanding if a guy you barley know or just met calls you individually to come hang out at a bar to drink with him and his friends.  As a woman you know there is more to it.  So she goes there and gets absolutely plastered.  Guy asks for a ride home she obliges.  He asks her to come in for more drinks and she says she just went to drink and didn't think it was anything more.  Well come on now...a guy of you don't know that well invites you up late at night as a woman you know what that is.  She than says oh we got really drunk I dont know how my clothes ended off and I kinda remember flashes of things.  First she says she doesn't remember sex.  And I tell her as a woman she would know the next day.  She finally admits.  I question if protection was used she says yes ofcourse.  But than if you can't remember how would you know.  So she makes me feel like an  asshole saying she doesn't remember the night and she is ashamed.  Well this deer in headlights things doesn't play well to me.  It seems like she would know why she is going to meet him and why she is going upstairs.  On further pressing she finally admits she remembers being on the bed making out with clothes on,  but once again ofcourse she doesn't remember how sex happened or how clothes got off,  and that she didn't know they would have sex.  I say lying on a a strange mans  bed and gooling around sexually and you don't think that?  Once again oh I can't remember what else happened.  Well eventually she admits she thought the guy was nice and she didn't know anyone down here and just wanted to be wanted.  So alot of the story doesn't add up together to me.

He starts calling me boy. \"Say that again, *boy*\". I told him he was acting like a jerk and acting immature. Now this guy gets right up to the desk, close as he can, and dares me to swing at him.

Here is when I began considering escalating the relationship to something more serious, but I didn\\'t get through with it.\\n\\nComes February, and 2 days before Valentine\\'s day (which was the day I intended to escalate it), she comes out angry at me because she thinks I was head over heels for another girl. She forced an answer out of me which didn\\'t make sense even to me. Do note that I once was indeed in love with that other girl, but by the time this happened, my feelings for the other girl were long gone. Then comes Valentine\\'s day, when I propose to escalate the relationship. But when I told her about taking it seriously, she just walked away furiously. That\\'s when shit started to go downhill for me. All of her friends started spamming me because apparently she STILL thought that I was going for both her and that other girl. Luckily, I managed to explain it to the mutual acquaintance, and she helped clear it out between us for a while. It worked.\\n\\nAfter the storm calmed down, I was still affected by the fact that she was angry at me, even though we still got along as if nothing happened. When we once stayed over at my place, she said that I was seemed more depressed than usual. I told her in a civilized way the reasons, and she suddenly reveals that she was already in a serious relationship with a russian guy she met on Chatroulette since New Year\\'s. I know myself that long distance relationships rarely work out, but either way still genuinely wished the best for her. I myself had broken up already from a LDR, and I knew how it felt having the only person that cares about you thousands of miles away. However, I got angry at the fact that she didn\\'t tell me before that she was in a relationship. A week passes, and everything is back to normality again.\\n\\nFast forward to April. I met another one of her friends while I was out with my friends. I try to greet her quite some times, but she doesn\\'t seem to pay any attention. I get frustrated a bit, and say under my breath something among the lines of \"oh for fuck\\'s sake can\\'t you at least return a greeting? (followed by something pretty nasty for a girl here, but normal among guys)\". She somehow didn\\'t hear my greetings, but she did hear the last part. She went off and told that I was talking shit about her to our mutual friend, and to the second protagonist of this anecdote. Arguments break out against me, 2 of her friends removed and blocked me, the mutual friend told me to stay away from them and her and blocked me aswell, and the girl I had feelings for drops a very angry voice note, blocking me aswell for a week, then unblocking me.\\n\\nSince then, I have tried apologizing to the girl personally, but to no avail. Whenever we see eachother face-to-face, she pretends that I don\\'t exist, and from her behaviour, I have developed a similar response; but I still feel horrible whenever I am near her, and just thinking about what happened makes me want to vomit.\\n\\nSo... was I the genuine asshole, or was I being played around with?', 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA for wanting to get back with a friend?

So the entire group jumps on the bandwagon - including myself - trying to figure it out, we all looked at pictures of the night and questioned people and stuff. She starts getting really shitty about the whole situation and starts saying really quite nasty things about whoever it was that took the champagne, naturally people are starting to give up and she starts abusing them. So people ask her how much the champagne was and it turned out to be just a £10 bottle from a corner-shop. This girl has a history of being an attention seeker and she's always kind of annoyed me, so yes this was a bit of me getting sick of her, but she really is your stereotypical über annoying privileged-private-school-girl. I messaged her saying that the fact that she's started this whole group and lied to people about the price and crucified whoever took the champagne was way out of order and that she should have just let it go.

There was a single photo of me holding the £10 bottle in question (proof?) and she leapt at the opportunity to blame me. She *reopened* the group, for the sole purpose of telling the group of people who'd attended that it was me. She posted pictures of the messages I'd sent her about how she'd blown the whole thing out of proportion, and deliberately omitted the messages I'd sent her apologising for what I'd done, and that I genuinely had no idea that I was the culprit.

The next morning the girl who hosted starts a Facebook group up titled who stole my champagne. So she writes in the description Hey guys last night was fun but someone stole my bottle of champagne and it was really expensive and I want to know which dickhead it was so they can pay me for being inconsiderate. So I'm like ok I suppose this is reasonable, thinking it was like an £80 (~120USD) bottle or something. So the entire group jumps on the bandwagon - including myself - trying to figure it out, we all looked at pictures of the night and questioned people and stuff. She starts getting really shitty about the whole situation and starts saying really quite nasty things about whoever it was that took the champagne, naturally people are starting to give up and she starts abusing them. So people ask her how much the champagne was and it turned out to be just a £10 bottle from a corner-shop. This girl has a history of being an attention seeker and she's always kind of annoyed me, so yes this was a bit of me getting sick of her, but she really is your stereotypical über annoying privileged-private-school-girl. I messaged her saying that the fact that she's started this whole group and lied to people about the price and crucified whoever took the champagne was way out of order and that she should have just let it go. She unsurprisingly says whatever and presumedly said nasty things about me to her friends.\\n\\nHere comes the plot twist:\\n\\nIt was me. I was the thief. In my defence I had absolutely no idea it was me. I had zero recollection of the nights events the next morning and nothing had come back to me. There was a single photo of me holding the £10 bottle in question (proof?) and she leapt at the opportunity to blame me. She reopened the group, for the sole purpose of telling the group of people who'd attended that it was me. She posted pictures of the messages I'd sent her about how she'd blown the whole thing out of proportion, and deliberately omitted the messages I'd sent her apologising for what I'd done, and that I genuinely had no idea that I was the culprit. I felt pretty persecuted and got a lot of messages from people telling me I was a dick. I obviously said I would pay for the £10 pound bottle of expensive champagne.

I understand if I'm the asshole I just want unbiased opinions on the matter.\\n\\n**EDIT:** I found out I was the culprit at the *very* end of the witch hunt. One of my mates found the picture and posted it half-jokingly, not really expecting anybody to care anymore, seeing as it was £10.\\n\\n**EDIT 2:** I didn't have the bottle to myself, I was pictured pouring the bottle into like 8 different cups in outstretched hands.\\n\\n**EDIT 3:** I drank the bottle with anybody who wanted some. I didn't literally steal. I didn't not consume and take it home.\\n\\n**EDIT 4:** I've paid her back already.

Alright I worked with a girl for a few years. I asked her out immediately and she turned me down but we develop a pretty good friendship. I love hanging out with her and I don\\'t even mind she isn\\'t interested.\\n\\nA few years go by of course and she does develop feelings for me but she still refuses to commit. Now days I would have been out, I don\\'t chase but back then I was new to the game. We went on dates a lot, I bought her flowers, we danced, kissed, but she would never say yes.\\n\\nOkay and this happened which was majorly assholish of her but I bought us both $40 tickets to a dance weekend that she promised to go to and she changed her mind for really no clear reason.\\n\\nBut that\\'s a tangent, so I meet her mom one night, great lady, she tells her to give me a chance, we start dating, and it\\'s the best two months ever. Her interest and mine went along perfectly. Then valentine\\'s day comes up and I tell her i want to take her out. She says she\\'d rather stay at home with her parents. I didn\\'t push it.\\n\\nBut then she slowly stops answering my text messages and after a week of just leaving me hanging I push, I ask her what\\'s going on, are we okay, do you want to break up? It\\'s my birthday, she says she loves me she\\'s just stressed, she might be moving, I see right through her but i don\\'t want to believe it\\'s happening.\\n\\nSo Im working one night and keep in mind Ive given her so many outs, I tell her if she wants to break up I understand, because she clearly can\\'t do confrontation. Im compelled to check out her instagram, our picture isn\\'t there. She deleted it, it must be over. I call her, she doesn\\'t answer, next day she tells me it was an accident and she was showing her friend the picture and it accidentally deleted. I don\\'t know if you\\'ve ever tried to delete on IG but come on. Then she says her phone fell out of her car and broke so that\\'s why she didn\\'t answer.\\n\\nI break up with her, reluctantly, she \"understands\". I go on a trip out of the country and get pissed so i call her out at sea and freak out on her calling her a liar and a psychopath. Instant karma, $450 phone bill when I get back. Check out her instagram again, she\\'s on a date. I freak the fuck out. Im throwing furniture, punching walls, she lead me on and screwed me over completely. Im bedridden for weeks, I loved this girl.\\n\\nCome to find out she\\'s sleeping with my \"friend\" who justifies it by saying her met her first. He gets a slashed tire.\\n\\n6 months goes by and I run into her the other day at the dance, her sister\\'s there with her. Me and her sister were cool but I hadn\\'t seen either of them since February because according to the sister she was in a car accident in the snow and wasn\\'t coming back until it warmed up. \\n\\nI see them there, say hey, do you want to dance? I dance with her sister. I bring up what she said about the accident. She says she never said that. I bitterly joke that she is lying \"just like her sister\". This results in an argument that gets louder than indoor volume. She says I hurt her feelings, huffs off to her sister, I try to damage control (and by that I mean I cussed them both the fuck out because I was enraged), ex calls me an asshole, haven\\'t seen her since.\\n\\n**TL;DR** I think my ex is insane, I got pissed and now Im an asshole.', 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'default', 'title': 'AITA for snapping at my ex girlfriend and her younger sister?', 'url': 'http://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/38dotb/aita_for_snapping_at_my_ex_girlfriend_and_her/'}, {'author': '[deleted]', 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'created_utc': 1433345201, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/38dpis/aita_for_pulling_a_prank_on_my_friend_and_ruining/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '38dpis', 'is_self': True, 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 1, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/38dpis/aita_for_pulling_a_prank_on_my_friend_and_ruining/', 'retrieved_on': 1440695035, 'score': 0, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': 'This happened a while back - before I discovered this subreddit.

My sisters have both been fat, though one got Lap Band surgery and lost a lot of weight. Both of their husbands are pretty fat, too. The only people in my family that haven\\'t been so fat as to push the limits of the human body are my brother and his wife, both of whom work out pretty extensively. I grew up fat, too. I\\'m 190 cm, and as I was growing up I got as heavy as 109 kg (240 lb). As a result of my weight, I was bullied pretty heavily (heh) from about age 7 to 18, which left me self-conscious of my weight - I have some pretty nasty Depression and Anxiety now. I\\'ve never even asked out a girl or started a conversation with a friend, because *why would they even respond to someone as fat and ugly as me?*\\n\\nEver since I\\'ve gone to uni, I\\'ve been trying to gain control of my weight, and I\\'ve been pretty successful. I\\'ve gone from 109 kg to 99. I do this mostly through calorie counting and exercise. Unfortunately, when I came home for the summer, my parents continued living the same lifestyle they had before I left - going out to eat every night at high-calorie restaurants (1000+ cal/meal) and driving everywhere in lieu of walking. Like, literally everywhere. Like, my mom drove half a block to talk to one of our neighbours the other day. Beyond that, my parents vocally disapprove of my habit of exercising at night - my social anxiety makes it uncomfortable to exercise during the day and I feel like people are judging me, plus it\\'s absurdly hot during the summer, so exercising during the day is effectively not an option for me. I\\'ve attempted to adjust my intake in order to compensate for the high-calorie dinners, cutting my breakfast and lunch from 700 calories (which I was eating for every meal) to 500 calories or less, but this hasn\\'t worked - it leaves me famished by the late hour at which my parents eat. The restaurants my parents like to frequent are also the type that leave chips or bread on the table before the main course comes, and with my hunger (I usually eat earlier than they do, plus I\\'m eating smaller meals now because of them) it\\'s difficult to resist whatever appetizer is left on the table. \\n\\nEvery night, when my parents and I go out to eat, we have effectively the same conversation. They suggest a place, I nix it because they don\\'t provide nutrition information and that place seems unhealthy. Rinse and repeat that process until they break my will and I finally agree to go somewhere that I don\\'t particularly like that is slowly killing me. Then, when we get there, I try to stop them from ordering whatever carbohydrate they\\'re offered to stuff their fat faces with until their salad (which I don\\'t order so as to save them money) arrives and they switch to that. They ignore me, order the bread and butter or chips and salsa or whatever the fuck else anyway. After I search pretty extensively on MyFitnessPal to find something that I can eat without turning into a land whale, we get our food and eat it. They then *insist* that I didn\\'t get enough to eat, and repeatedly offer me portions of their food. When I protest, they insist that I\\'m losing too much weight (again, I\\'m 190 cm and 99 kg, I\\'m still overweight) and that I\\'m worrying too much about my diet and can afford a \"cheat day\" (which they insist should be everyday). This all leaves me with a lot of guilt - and I\\'ve let my parents know that. Plus, I eat fast and it\\'s not easy to sit there and watch your morbidly obese family finish their meals while they badger you to eat more.\\n\\nLast night it finally bubbled over. After my parents ordered the bread product to the table at yet another restaurant where I didn\\'t know what I could afford to eat and where the nutrition information went unpublished, I broke. On the verge of tears, I asked why they never listened to me about stuff like this, at which point they said that it wasn\\'t their diet and they shouldn\\'t be responsible for making it easier on me. After all, they said, at Birthday parties (which happen just about every weekend in my family) there isn\\'t always a dessert option for my diabetic mother, and she has to eat \"just a little bit.\" Of course, that obviously isn\\'t an every night thing, and the vast majority of the time there\\'s a sugar-free dessert option there *just for her.* I got upset, said they didn\\'t really understand, and kind of looked down at the table (once again, on the verge of tears). My father said I was acting like a child, and sent me outside, told me to get dinner elsewhere and meet them back at the vehicle when they were done (which I gladly did). All I\\'ve asked them to do, to reiterate, is to eat a little bit earlier and to not order whatever optional carbohydrate they\\'re offered, just to make it a little easier on me. \\n\\nAm I the asshole for asking my parents to make dieting easier on me, and then getting mad when they said no?', 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA for getting mad at my parents for not making my diet easier on me?', 'url': 'http://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/38ech3/aita_for_getting_mad_at_my_parents_for_not_making/'}, {'author': 'russharv9', 'author_created_utc': 1359252787, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'author_fullname': 't2_adjgq', 'created_utc': 1433353172, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/38ed51/aita_for_wanting_to_kick_someone_out_of_my_band/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '38ed51', 'is_self': True, 'link_flair_css_class': 'not', 'link_flair_text': 'not the asshole', 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 14, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/38ed51/aita_for_wanting_to_kick_someone_out_of_my_band/', 'post_hint': 'self', 'preview': {'images': [{'id': 'VbrQ-viFeh0zC3hj_m2YpqnqVIJgx1_P6QLQKTrzr_8', 'resolutions': [{'height': 81, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/5YMXNuNPJ7KjbbjWYpRYPplxXN47fWXkXohLgqcm9Ew.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=85c289c826f8ad4d660338e06b049f24', 'width': 108}, {'height': 162, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/5YMXNuNPJ7KjbbjWYpRYPplxXN47fWXkXohLgqcm9Ew.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=d4246450232da3cc19382334ac39bde7', 'width': 216}, {'height': 240, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/5YMXNuNPJ7KjbbjWYpRYPplxXN47fWXkXohLgqcm9Ew.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=0377f8ed6ae2b11274a64b20a540e3de', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://i.redditmedia.com/5YMXNuNPJ7KjbbjWYpRYPplxXN47fWXkXohLgqcm9Ew.jpg?s=cb3a90c5c1204ff087456e855ffc14f3', 'width': 480}, 'variants': {}}]}, 'retrieved_on': 1440694729, 'score': 6, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': 'In my band, I\\'m the bassist (inb4 \"why is the bassist complaining about someone being dumb?\") and for a while, we\\'ve been wanting to kick out our vocalist.

He refused to throw in, not because it would\\'ve put a crimp in his finances, but because he didn\\'t comprehend the point.\\n\\n* 2 months after bragging about having enough money to replace any piece of equipment we, as a band, owned, he has now had to pick up a 2nd job after falling behind on rent.  In that time, he decided to buy **A GODDAMNED SAILBOAT.**\\n\\n* One of two vehicle owners in the band, has a truck that could be useful to get to a from peformances, but it needs a windshield replacement, an alignment, new tires, and fluids replaced.  Spends money on a boat and his street bike instead.\\n\\n* On the day of a performance, he chooses to ride to a town that is an hour away from our rehearsal space an hour before we agreed to meet.  He then gets stuck in traffic, causing him to be 2.5 hours late.  The reason?  He wanted to refill his tank of whippets.\\n\\nSo tell me...am I the asshole for wanting to get rid of him simply because he\\'s stupid?', 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': \"AITA for wanting to kick someone out of my band because he's stupid?\", 'url': 'http://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/38ed51/aita_for_wanting_to_kick_someone_out_of_my_band/'}, {'author': '[deleted]', 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'created_utc': 1433353718, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/38eesn/aita_for_thinking_the_relationship_workload_is/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '38eesn', 'is_self': True, 'link_flair_css_class': '', 'link_flair_text': 'everyone sucks', 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 11, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/38eesn/aita_for_thinking_the_relationship_workload_is/', 'retrieved_on': 1440694707, 'score': 5, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': \"So just some short context.

So there are many reasons, the most important being... my spiritual growth, the next would be my relationship with my lady friend.\\n\\n3 weeks ago I announced to \"leaders\" of small group, which she is one. That I am no longer coming to church, because I will be going to an American Church.\\n\\nShe, of course was shocked and wanted to know why and wanted to meet up. I laid it out to her, my feelings, my focus, my spirituality. Let\\'s just say after the talk, I did make her tear up, I\\'ve never felt so firm and douchey haha. I\\'ve been stuck on this girl for a long time... and I\\'m ready to move on, I\\'ve been stuck in this church, spiritually, and ready to move on. I thought to myself, this seems selfish, but it\\'s about time to watch out for myself and grow.\\n\\n\\n\\nHonestly, I feel great right now. Just because the feels aren\\'t being pulled. Sometimes I felt like she was taking advantage, I was being used, and maybe I had a chance with her(partially why I kept my feelings for her)... but then again I don\\'t know. We\\'ve been really good friends for a long time, and I felt like me staying at the church and seeing her would just make things worse. \\n\\nOh I must say, she\\'s recently obtained a bf. In which, she has brought to church events. Thank the Lord, I wasn\\'t there when she did. I just feel like I wouldn\\'t be able to handle it, and make things awkward for her, and myself... and in the end make things worse for our friendship relationship.

I wonder frequently who was in the wrong, and I wanted an outside opinion.\\n\\nBackstory:\\nSenior year of high school, my best friend Oswald\\'s girlfriend Samantha cheated on him. This was a big deal, but it was a bigger deal because that the guy she hooked up with was another member of our friend group, who had been previously super close to Oswald and I, knowing both of us for around eight years. I belong to the camp of once-a-cheater-always-a-cheater, so after that I never trusted her. Oswald stayed with Samantha but the offending guy was, rather unfairly, excommunicated.\\n\\nNow the event.\\nSamantha\\'s closest friend is another guy in the group, Quincy. Quincy and Samantha texted and snapchatted pretty much constantly, but I wasn\\'t close enough to either of them to worry about it or really think about the content. Oswald and I were still close, but I\\'d also become really close with Quincy\\'s best friend, Dave. One night Dave and I were talking over some video games, and it came up that both of us were suspicious about Quincy and Samantha\\'s friendship. Dave told me that Quincy had confided in him about some things, which to me, if they were true, suggested that there could be something going on. \\n\\nAccording to Dave, Samantha and Quincy frequently talked about how if Samantha and Oliver should ever break up, they would definitely hook up, and talked often about how attracted they were to each other. Samantha also told Quincy that she would be more than willing to be his New Year\\'s kiss if he didn\\'t have someone. Dave told me that Quincy seemed very evasive about Samantha in conversation, and that he refused to give Dave any sort of details about when they met up or spent time together. I was incensed. \\n\\nI told Dave that he should tell Oswald immediately, but he told me that he didn\\'t know Oswald well enough, and he said that because he thought it was mainly just flirting that it \"wasn\\'t his place\". I told him I understood, and said I wouldn\\'t act on anything until we knew something for sure. Later that day though, I was seeing Oswald anyway, and I kept thinking in my head that I had to say something. My reasoning being that if I even had a reasonable suspicion, I should say something to him, because it\\'s what I would want him to do if our situations were swapped. As we were parting I told him that I didn\\'t know anything for sure, but that based on a conversation I had had with Dave, he should keep his eyes open about something going on between Samantha and Quincy. I told him not to do anything rash. He asked if I had any evidence and I said no, just a suspicion based on what Dave had told me. \\n\\nThe next day my phone blows up. Quincy and Samantha are furious with me about how I could accuse them of this. Evidently, Oswald had texted both of them and told them what I said. They both denied it, and were beyond angry with me. This was to be expected, and I still felt satisfied thinking I had done the right thing. Things got worse though, because when Quincy found out what Dave had told me, they had a fight and Dave stopped talking to me. I talked to Oswald and told him that I was sorry for causing this problem. He said it was fine and I made the right decision, but that I was totally wrong and that nothing was going on. He conceded that he handled things to rashly but said it would all be alright. Since then, we have not spoken. I at first assumed Samantha was just keeping him from visiting me, since him and I go to different colleges, but now I\\'ve found that he just ignores all of my texts or attempts at contact. \\n\\nI lost three friends out of this and I feel totally stupid and regretful, but whenever I tell anyone about it they all rally to me and say that I was doing what I thought was best so it\\'s okay.\\n\\nWhat do you think reddit?\\n\\nEdit: Changed letters to names.', 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA for telling my friend I had a suspicion his girlfriend was cheating on him?', 'url': 'http://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/38exz9/aita_for_telling_my_friend_i_had_a_suspicion_his/'}, {'author': 'ClaraFromMathClass', 'author_created_utc': 1417402110, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'author_fullname': 't2_jpoms', 'created_utc': 1433362914, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/38f5ey/aita_for_keeping_my_child_from_her_biological/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '38f5ey', 'is_self': True, 'link_flair_css_class': 'not', 'link_flair_text': 'not the asshole', 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 12, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/38f5ey/aita_for_keeping_my_child_from_her_biological/', 'retrieved_on': 1440694362, 'score': 2, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': 'Alright, that title may have been misleading, but you\\'re all only getting my side of the story here so I want to make sure I paint a very clear picture.\\n\\nFive and 1/2 years ago, I had a baby with a man that I married.  He was 19, I was 21.  He came from a family with very detached parents, I came from a loving, close-knit family.  We were very much the products of our upbringing.  We stayed together until she was ten months old.  During that ten months he was rarely around.  He would stay out until he knew I had her put to bed for the night.  He couldn\\'t stand the sound of her crying, he would never allow himself to be left alone with her.  Looking back as an adult, it is very clear he was young, inexperienced and terrified.  At the time, I was also young and inexperienced, and didn\\'t understand why he couldn\\'t just love and spend time with our daughter.\\n\\nHe left when she was ten months old, letting me know that I could contact him for child support but he wasn\\'t interested in raising this child.  Once he moved out, I didn\\'t let him move back in, but when he came around feeling sorry for his actions, I wanted him to see our daughter so I allowed visits.\\n\\nAfter the first couple of visits, he started coming later and later and eventually began showing up after she was in bed.  When I realized he was visiting ME instead of HER, I put a stop to it.  He became angry and again told me that he didn\\'t want to have anything to do with the child.\\n\\nThis time, I decided there were no take-backs.  From my point of view, I didn\\'t want my daughter to deal with a father that was in-and-out of her life. By this time, she was only a year old, but eventually she would grow up and I never wanted her to hear her own father say outloud that he wanted nothing to do with her.\\n\\nWe went through the court for our divorce that year.  Having never actually been left alone with our daughter, he was given supervised visitation once/week through a facility in our county.  He attended the first few times and then just stopped showing up.  He didn\\'t even show up to the last two divorce/custody hearings and they ended up finalizing it without him present.  \\n\\nNow my daughter is 5 and 1/2.  I\\'ve always been honest with her about the situation to an age-appropriate level.  (You used to have another daddy, but he knew he wasn\\'t very good at being a daddy so he went away so that your life could be filled with love and joy.  Then it was just you and me for a while until we met _[my husband]__ and now he takes good care of you.)  She loves her step-dad, knows he isn\\'t her biological father but she wants to call him Dad anyway.  She is happy and healthy and thriving.\\n\\nMy ex recently contacted me to ask if we could get together outside of court so he could get to know her.  I didn\\'t even text him back.  As I said before, my child is happy and healthy and I don\\'t want a sudden new daddy to fuck that up for her.  My theory is that since he chose when to leave, I\\'ll let HER choose when they meet up.  I plan to give her the choice when she is older and I feel she is  mature enough.  \\n\\nWe come from a small town, he still talks to friends of friends of friends of mine.  Word has come back to me that people now thing I am this horrible bitch, witholding this poor man from seeing his daughter even when he is repenting for his actions.  \\n\\nI honestly don\\'t even see him as \"the asshole\" except for the spreading of his pity party.  I see him as a troubled teen who got scared and couldn\\'t handle the task of raising a child.

I guess they were super close in elementary school and were at the very least acquaintances in middle school. It made me somewhat uncomfortable and I expressed it, but got reassured every time.

I REALLY liked her and I thought we were friends, we would walk together after class, went to each others parties, etc. ALL WITHOUT MY BF AT THE TIME.

I don\\'t get along with girls, mainly guys. that\\'s why I hardly intervened with them hanging out, I\\'d be a hypocrite. When I realized how often they were hanging out, (EVERY DAY AFTER WE HAD FINISHED) I asked what the difference was between us. \"Well I love you both. but I love her like a sister.\" Which shut me up. well we broke up and the same day, she told him that she liked him. Seems pretty fucked up, right? They start dating, this entire time she avoids the topic of him in every conversation like the fucking plague. I had to bring it up and even then she was shy about it. I still somewhat talk to my ex and I vented to him and he said that she was probably overcome with guilt.

But the friend involved, my group of friends and I still not have reached the end of the debate.\\n\\nSo, first a bit of context.\\nI moved to Switzerland a couple of year ago, two years before the end of high school. I made lots of new friends, included Meg. When I met Meg, she had been dating Ryan for a few years, and I never was interested in her. She's not my type, and for as long as I had known her she was dating Ryan. Really, no interest at all. And Meg and Ryan have a very strong/jealous relationship, it's kind of crazy.\\n\\nA few years after I moved to Switzerland, I went to Mexico to visit some friends. While I was planning the trip, Meg told me that she would be studying english in San Diego and that since Mexico and San Diego are on the same continent I might as well visit, to which I answered yes. So I spent a week in Mexico, then took a plane to San Diego and had a blast.\\n\\nExcept that one day, Meg's school planned a two days trip to LA. She offered me to come, I said yes of course, and here we went. We arrived in LA in the morning, and went straight to Disneyland. We walked around the park the whole day, had a blast, and by the end of the day I was exhausted. Now, Meg and I shared a hotel room. Each of us had a king size bed, in the same room. This is where it gets interesting.\\n\\nI always sleep naked, always. Unless I'm sharing my bed with a friend, or sleeping in a narrow bed, sharing a room and risk to move the blankets away in my sleep. This was not the occasion on that night. We had very big beds, lots of blankets on them, nothing could happen. So Meg and I went to bed, I undressed under the blanket (she didn't notice), and got ready to sleep.\\n\\nBut Meg asked me to turn the lights off, and I had to get out of bed to do that. I stalled a bit, told her I was tired blablabla, and then plainly told her that I didn't wanna get dressed again just do to that.\\n\\nThat's when she realized I was naked under the blankets, and she threw a tantrum.\\n\\nWe had a huge discussion, and here arguments to tell me I shouldn't be naked were :\\n\\n* It was a lack of respect to her boyfriend, whom she hadn't seen in months and was still in Switzerland\\n* She felt uncomfortable knowing I was naked under the blankets\\n* I could move the blankets away during my sleep and expose myself to her\\n* What if I had to pee during the night, would I walk around naked?\\n\\nMy arguments were :\\n\\n* There are 3 layers of blankets, she wouldn't be able to see anything\\n* I sleep way better naked, and I needed a good night of sleep\\n* I respect her relationship with Ryan and am not gonna do anything\\n* She wouldn't have noticed I was naked unless I had told her\\n* I don't move a lot when I sleep, so there is absolutely no way the blankets will fall during the night\\n\\n\\nThese arguments didn't convince any of us, so we went to bed very angry at each other, I slept naked, nothing happened, and we didn't talk to each other for a couple of days before making peace after this event.\\nNow the thing is, she told Ryan what happened the day after and Ryan was really pissed at me.\\n\\nAlmost 5 years after we still talk about it when we're all together, and no solution to this question was found.

Out of the two of them, I would say I\\'m closer to J, but we\\'ve lived together at uni since September. We\\'re all part of a larger group of friends and we have a Facebook group chat that we use to just all talk. C and J seem to have a love/hate friendship and often get into arguments of sorts, but always seem to make up in the end.\\n\\nA few hours ago, we were all just having a conversation on there which I was only loosely following and not really participating in. C then joins in and informs us that she\\'s drunk. We then realise J isn\\'t in the chat for some reason (we later find out someone jokingly kicked him a few weeks before and he never got reinvited), and C then begins to badmouth the band J is in, in this chat **which J is supposed to be in**. Also, J and his girlfriend recently broke up, so she also commented how he\\'s just been feeling sorry for himself lately and it\\'s annoying her.\\n\\nDuring all this, another friend (D) tells C to delete the messages because he\\'s going to invite J back into the chat. She does so, but doesn\\'t realise it only deletes it for you looking at it. D invites J back in, he says, says \"Fuck off C\" and leaves. I come in at this point saying \"you know he could see those right?\" and she\\'s like \"that\\'s why I deleted them\" and I said \"it only deletes for you...\". No-one else said anything then so I was just like \"meh whatever\".\\n\\nA few minutes later, J asks me if I can reinvite him. I, knowing what he\\'s like, ask him why and he says \"to see what C put\". This then puts me in an awkward position: if I don\\'t invite J, he\\'ll be mad at me. If I do, C will be mad at me. I tell him \"I\\'ll only invite you if you don\\'t start an argument in the chat\", and invite him back. Lo and behold, he starts arguing. I tell him in the group chat to drop it and talk to Cat privately. Again, it all goes silent and I\\'m like \"thank god that\\'s over\".\\n\\nNOPE. Another few minutes later, C messages me saying \"thanks for that\". I quite bluntly tell her he asked me to reinvite him, and not to say stuff online if she doesn\\'t want to risk people seeing it. She then tells me to \"stop being so righteous and up myself as it pisses people off\", implying this isn\\'t something only she feels, and it\\'s not sudden.\\n\\nWas then just talking to my closest friend in the group (K) about it all and she says C made a chat with her and D when I reinvited J and basically bitched about me in it, calling me an \"arselicker\" (idk if that\\'s used in America, but \"brown-nosing\" is an equivalent term I think?). She then proceeds to change the group chat title to an obvious dig at me for \"people who obviously never bitch about others ever and are so fabulous\" and kick me and J from it.\\n\\nI tend to not get involved in their arguments, and whenever I do, I try not to pick sides and be as impartial as I can. Basically, should I have invited J back to the chat? He\\'d obviously already seen what C had said, but I wasn\\'t sure if he still could after being kicked.

It\\'s to the point where in the entirety of 2014, I was alone in the apartment for 45 minutes total.\\n\\nI don\\'t like being bothered when I\\'m cooking - I just want to keep my head down and get on with it, and because of this I rarely use the kitchen.  Someone always comes out and wants to talk to me, or use the stove at the same time, and I don\\'t like being distracted.  Because I get annoyed, I try to remove myself from this situation as much as possible.\\n\\nToday I wanted to sneak in some raviolis for dinner.  They were fresh from a market that makes them on site.  Because they were never frozen, total cook time once the water is boiling is around five minutes.  These are the kind of stealth meals I try to make.  \\n\\nThe girlfriend (who is also a rent paying tenant in this apartment - four people in a five bedroom, in a tight rental market, in a decent location) had asked me to bring these raviolis home and make them because she had come from the dentist and wanted to eat something soft for dinner.\\n\\nI get home, and the roommate had every surface area in the kitchen covered in food prep work.  Cutting boards, vegetables, packaging, measuring cups, pots and pans, etc.  He had all four stove burners going.\\n\\nKeep in mind, he is home all day.  He has hours and hours of alone time every single day of the week.  \\n\\nNormally when this happens - and it happens a lot - I\\'ll just get delivery even if I was planning on cooking that night.  Often, even if I had just come from the grocery store with dinner.  But the girlfriend had her heart set on these raviolis.  So I basically told her \"I can\\'t deal with being down here, I will literally go anywhere with you right now, I will bring home food from a restaurant down the street, I will pay for delivery, I will go to the grocery store and get you whatever you want, there\\'s just no room for me to make these raviolis for you.\"  But she insisted on making them herself, so I removed myself from the situation.  I guess she got him to give up one of the burners and had to dance around him while she heated them up and and then used the same pot for the sauce I had also brought home.\\n\\nThe thing is, I said all this *right in front of him*.  He can surely tell that I get annoyed at him for doing stuff like this, but I\\'ve never \"had a conversation\" with him about it because who am I to tell him when he can or can\\'t use a common area?  I don\\'t feel like I have the right to do that.  Even if I requested it, I don\\'t think he\\'d care.  I\\'ve asked once or twice to use a common room to watch a football game and he sat in the same room the whole time watching a movie on his laptop, no headphones.  He\\'s not a bad guy, it\\'s just that unless it\\'s someone\\'s closed bedroom, he just doesn\\'t give a fuck about boundaries and I\\'ve given up.\\n\\nI don\\'t think my outburst phased him too much - it\\'s two hours later and he\\'s still cooking.  \\n\\nBut I do feel bad for my passive aggressive behavior.

For this story, let\\'s call the guy I met Logan, and the mutual friend Kevin to make this less confusing.  Also, we\\'re all 16 years old.  Yeah, this is going to be really petty.\\n\\nI\\'ve seen him before in the hallways at school, but we never talked until Kevin made a group chat with our phone numbers (he made it because Logan needed advice and wanted me to talk to him).  We talked and we got on really well, met in person at a party, and now we text just the two of us.  Logan and I started to develop feelings for each other and we texted each other often in a flirty manner.  He often told me things like \"you\\'re beautiful. you\\'re a cutie. you\\'re perfect to me.\"  Once he told me that I was his \"favorite human, favorite girl, favorite reliable friend, favorite humorous friend\" and etc that honestly, it made me really touched.  Then we hung out once, and we had a lot of fun.  He even admitted to me a little before we hung out that he liked me.  I told him that I liked him too.  But for some reason, he never asked me to be his girlfriend despite having many good chances to.\\n\\nThings started to go downhill a while after that.  One day, Kevin texted me asking me if I really liked Logan.  I said \"that\\'s a funny question to ask.\"  and then Kevin told me that Logan just wanted to be good friends.  That made me devastated.. I kind of started to get upset at him, and before I started freaking out and saying something I regret I asked him to stop texting me.  Then I texted Logan and asked if he really asked Kevin to tell me that.  He said yes.. and explained it was because \"you\\'re amazing and all, but I\\'ve had my heart broken a lot from liking people and from past relationships and I\\'m not ready to date ANYONE. but when I\\'m ready I\\'ll tell you. right now I just want to be close friends.\"  (To be honest, I think he\\'s only had one girlfriend though?  Makes me wonder why he\\'d feel this way, but who am I to question him when I don\\'t know his entire history..?) He expressed a lot of concern when I was upset, saying that he felt terrible and couldn\\'t eat.  So I made sure that I looked happy and told him that I was okay the next day, despite still feeling like absolute shit.  \\n\\nHe didn\\'t really treat me the same after that.  He no longer was flirty and no longer complimented me a lot like he used to.  I can live with that, but admittedly I really liked the attention since boys have never treated me like that before...  And he started to text me less and less.  Before, he\\'d text me right when he woke up, right after school, and until we went to bed.  Now he takes forever to text me, he\\'d usually text me at 7:00 at night.  Logan once asked \"why don\\'t you text me :(\" though..  I told him that I was afraid I\\'d be annoying him and that he might be actually busy, but I would start to text him first.  I tried that once, it went okay, then the next time he\\'d take forever to reply, saying excuses like \"sorry I was at work. sorry I thought I sent you that message.\" which I\\'m not sure if I can 100% believe.  Now he doesn\\'t text me unless he needs something from me like when does school start tomorrow and all that..\\n\\nYesterday he texted me \"Hey, are you mad at me or something.\"  I told him \"Umm, what?  Why?\"  Logan then told me someone told him that I was.  Which was strange because I never said ANYTHING about being mad at him to anyone.  I told him that, and I admitted that I do talk about him sometimes to my trusted friends.  Logan asked what I talk about.  And well....\\n\\nWhen I talk about him, I mostly talked about how our relationship is going,  asked for advice, how attractive, adorable, and amazing he is, yknow.  And I REALLY did not want to admit that.  Logan kept bugging me to tell him(mostly over text), and I kept telling him no in a joke-y manner.  He kind of acted like that until he finally said \"Fine, be that way.\"  I realized that he was serious, and I texted him a sincere apology saying sorry that I\\'m being a jerk to you (was I?) , that my friend and I like to talk about boys and I just talk about him in general and what he\\'s said to me (I just said basically that, nothing about advice as I\\'ve stated before. ) and that I didn\\'t want to admit anything because maybe he\\'d be weirded out.  He hasn\\'t replied since then.\\n\\nNow, am I being the asshole or is it him? I\\'ve felt like that he\\'s been leading me on because he was saying all those things about liking me and then telling me that a relationship wasn\\'t going to happen.  But I try to understand that he\\'s probably afraid to get his heart broken again and all.  But if he didn\\'t want a relationship though, why did he treat me all special and then break MY heart?  Plus he didn\\'t really understand why that made me feel upset.. he was asking why I was upset and then just said again \"I never said I wouldn\\'t date you.. I just wouldn\\'t date ANYBODY.\"  And now he won\\'t text me, I\\'m assuming he is mad that I wouldn\\'t admit what I say about him.  I haven\\'t texted him myself, the last thing I sent was the apology and I haven\\'t seen him in school.   But I apologized and I finally told him some part of it so he can stop bugging me.. Why is he still mad?  It\\'s kind of petty imo.  Was that really that bad?\\n\\nHe is often known as a very nice kid. If you\\'d ask someone what he was like they\\'d most likely say \"he is the sweetest and most adorable guy ever.  he would bend over backwards to help you, etc.\"  When I tell my mom about how our relationship is kind of not going well she says \"he\\'s such a nice kid I don\\'t think he\\'s avoiding you because he\\'s mad at you.\"  Which makes me doubt myself.. Is it really all my fault? Did I do something wrong without realizing it?  Did I do something when we hung out? Did he change his mind about me and thinks that I\\'m weird and annoying? I really don\\'t get it.\\n\\nI\\'m sorry if this is confusing because it\\'s not written very well.  I\\'m a terrible writer, so if you need me to elaborate on something I\\'d be happy to.\\n\\n', 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'Am I the asshole for not wanting to tell him what I say when I talk about him to my friends?

I\\'ll try to be as unbiased as possible, but I apologize in advance.\\n\\n**~~A Little~~ Background on Me, The Autistic schoolmate, and my school:**  \\nI\\'m jewish. Not particularly religious, but I don\\'t take antisemitism very kindly. Normally I can brush certain things off, as long as they\\'re very clearly in fun, even when they\\'re not so friendly I can laugh it off myself. Physically I\\'m big enough to come off as intimidating, I\\'m built very heavily from weightlifting but I\\'m also very lean. A bear-jew, if you will.\\n\\nAs for the person that I beat up, this is what I know about him: He surely has some experience with being bullied. He doesn\\'t come off as normal in appearance or behavior and he clearly has a disorder on the Autism Spectrum. Physically he\\'s long and skinny, with almost albino white skin and very bright blond hair, and a scruffy blond neckbeard. Disregarding all of that, this kid is absolutely brilliant when it comes to Math and Science. For the rest of the post, let\\'s call him Mike.\\n\\nMy particular highschool is a small, publicly funded so not private, \"specialized\" school for people with interest in STEM fields. 150 kids at most and every single one of them is a huge nerd, including me. Among other things my school comes off as a safe-haven for kids who have had experience as a victim of bullying, and as a matter of fact my \"fight\" with Mike was the first physical \"fight\" at the school in at least 4 years.\\n\\n\\n**Prelude to Story for extra background:**  \\nThe fight happened when we were both Juniors, so we had known each other for the better half of 3 years. He\\'s said things that have gotten on everybody\\'s nerves, many of these things were along the lines of bragging about his intelligence. Nobody would say he came off as nice, and everybody after so long had come to the conclusion that he had some severe mental disorder. \\n\\nHe tended to say things to specifically get on people\\'s nerves, as well. Not just once, he would repeat them very often.\\n\\nThe past few years, between high school and the internet, have included the most antisemitism that I\\'ve ever been exposed to. It might be a new trend and it might just be growing up to realize it was there all along, whatever. I became the target of jew-jokes, and for quite a while I handled it very well. When Mike hopped on board with the trend (or whatever) he didn\\'t quite seem to get the patterns in what actually made jew-jokes funny. He would mostly go into the holocaust, and say jokes about Jew\\'s being gassed and burned, while the norm seemed to mostly be about Jews being greedy, of course with the occasional Holocaust reference which was deemed funny for its shock value.\\n\\n**Now for what I may be an asshole for:**  \\n*I\\'ll refer to myself as Moishe when needed*  \\nOne day, a Wednesday, I was going off task while in a group project with him and another student who-- this doesn\\'t actually matter too much-- was half-black. Mike wasn\\'t too happy about this but I continued to goof off. \\n\\nHe finally said the words \"Moishe, you\\'re justifying the holocaust.\"\\n\\nAs open to interpretation as this might seem, it was in fact quite clear what he was saying, as it had been said to me before with clearer context: I, by being a jew who was annoying him, was justifying the genocide of the people I represent. Despite what you might think, this is not what I got mad and beat him up for. I did get mad, but was thinking about a big standardized test that was the next day, which I didn\\'t want to miss by being suspended or expelled.\\n\\nThe next day, after the test was over I was talking to a friend about why I was mad at Mike at that particular moment in time, and I talked about what he said to piss me off. He jokingly suggested kicking his ass, which got me thinking about what I could possibly get away with. \\n\\nThe next day, Friday I had the same class as on Wednesday, and was continuing to work (maybe not so hard) on the group project with him. I was still very mad about what Mike said, so I decided to recreate the circumstances. I started to goof off and antagonize him to an extent, just to get him annoyed enough to say the same thing again. The goal being *this* time I could actually physically retaliate without worrying about getting suspended before a big test. I wasn\\'t just going to beat him up without him saying anything right then and there, I had to have enough witnesses knowing what I was beating him up for. Once I got him to say the same exact words, I started to yell at him and call him a Nazi.\\n\\nAdjacent to the half-black person he says the words \"At least I\\'m not a nigger\"\\n\\nI continued to yell at him more and more, this time with the full support of our half-black friend (he wasn\\'t participating in the yelling, but it was clear he was on \"my side\")\\n\\nWith the attention of a solid third of the class, he says again \"Moishe, stop justifying the holocaust.\"\\n\\nAnd then I beat him up.\\n\\nI got the entire school cheering for me beating up the kid that nobody liked because he was Autistic, for saying something that I wasn\\'t even that mad about, mostly just mad that he thought he could get away with saying it. Am I the asshole?\\n\\n**EDIT:** I just want to add that we both actually walked away fine, me with a bloody lip from when he threw something at me. The worst thing I did in the long run was probably the psychological impact he received by someone basically attacking him for something he said. \\n\\nI think it\\'s settled that I\\'m the asshole, but (and sorry if saying this makes me more of an asshole) I can\\'t say I\\'d handle it differently if it happened again. It\\'s worth being an asshole if I can get someone, regardless of their mental health, to be afraid of publicly saying things that support the holocaust. \\n\\n**EDIT #2:**\\n\\n**Breakdown of the physicality, which originally I thought not to be important:**  \\nMe beating him up went a little like this. I started yelling things at him and letting real rage actually get out of me. I stood up, and grabbed his chair to try to get him to face me and look me in the eye (it actually took a long time to decide whether I would go through with getting physical) but things escalated quicker than anticipated because right then and there is what actually started the fight: When I grabbed his chair, I pulled too hard and he fell right out of it, onto the floor. He took this as the \"first swing\" and quickly stood up, and in a somewhat mechanical fashion, he threw his open binder at my head, and the open rings scratched me and drew blood from my forehead and my top lip. The class (100% were watching at this point) considered this the \"first swing.\" I grabbed his shoulders and swung him around to start hitting him, but he ducked fairly quickly and all of my punches actually skimmed his back, IIRC. A girl was screaming \"stop fighting\" just like in that one Key &amp; Peele bit, and I sort of didn\\'t know what to do at that point to I stepped away.\\n\\n**What happened after the situation:**  \\nAs I mentioned before, I got the whole school cheering for me and assuring me that they took my side. I went to the Vice Principle\\'s office and he went to the head-counselor-guy\\'s office and talked about what happened to our respective recipient. Side-note: Some of you said I should have talked to a special-ed guy about Mike\\'s behavior, but somehow the special-ed guy didn\\'t actually get involved at all. Both Mike and I independently agreed to having a meeting with each other, supervised by the head-counselor-guy and the Vice Principle. This is the meeting where it became quite clear to me that he knew exactly what he was saying and that he intended for it to be hurtful, not a joke. After he admitted that, he became a broken record of \"it\\'s both of our faults, but we should forget it and move on.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s it, I suppose. Everything else I could really contribute has either already been said or is personal info that I\\'d rather avoid.

I texted my brother my credit card information after the first call so he can order while I\\'m not there. It was getting extremely late and I called one more time to have them make the order because after a certain time the place stops delivering. My father got pissed at me because I kept calling and trying to make sure dinner was taken care of and he told me to mind my business and stop calling and stop being annoying. This in turn upset me so I told my brother to forget about ordering and delete all my CC info that I gave him. I told him specifically not to use my card and **do not** buy anything.\\n\\nAround 10pm we are finally finished with the hospital, and my mom calls the house to check up on my father and brother. I overhear her say that food was ordered. I quickly check my bank account and I find out my money was used and it was *a lot.* To say I wasn\\'t angry was a understatement. I was **livid.** I quickly explain to my mom why I was so angry and hurt because I was first yelled at for trying to make sure the family was fed and then my brother went behind my back and used my money after I told him not to.\\n\\nWhen we got home I couldn\\'t even look at my father and brother. I went to the bathroom, took a deep breath and told myself to just suck it up and just eat my food. I sit down and the first words out of my father\\'s mouth are \"Why is her face all twisted?\" My mom says ask me instead of her. I tell my dad I\\'m fine, and my mom starts explaining why I\\'m upset. My dad casually brushes off what she says by saying, \"Oh, well she should of just called if she didn\\'t want us to order, and if she wanted a particular item off the menu she should of called\" I calmly put down my fork and say, \"Excuse me, I called MULTIPLE times to tell you to order not too late and you yelled at me and tole me to stop calling. Beside I told (and I pointed to my brother) him to tell you I\\'m not ordering anymore because of your attitude.\" That of course he didn\\'t want to hear and proceeded to yell saying how he never yelled, and my mom cut in saying she heard him yelling at me in the hospital when I was on the phone. I told my father I did not appreciate the way he spoke me and I also mentioned that he continues to not respect anything I say. \\n\\nHe blew up telling me to shut the F up and I can because I\\'m the father, to which I screamed at him that that\\'s not the way you speak to your daughter and it was just a constant back and forth with him getting in my face and telling me to shut up and eat my food. He then told me if I don\\'t like it I can GTFO the house and I quote, \"IF YOU DON\\'T LIKE IT GET A REAL JOB AND GTFO OF MY HOUSE! YOU WANT RESPECT GET OUT. I\\'M TIRED OF YOUR SHIT AND I\\'M DONE\" He kept trying to get in my face to hit me but my brother was keeping him down and he finally went upstairs.\\n\\n**TL;DR:** I was trying to order out for the family because both my mom and I couldn\\'t be there.

Prom is Saturday night and the bus for prom houses leave right after prom, and generally most people come back on the bus Tuesday night. \\n\\nAnyway, my group's prom house started forming around early October, when I submitted an initial deposit of $21 to the girl running it - let's call her Eileen. About a month later I met my current girlfriend and started dating her, problem is she wasn't from my town and people generally don't allow people who are juniors or out of town to come down to the prom houses. However there are instances where other people outside of the designated prom house come down for a bit. \\n\\nSo I submitted another deposit around January of $118 (although I actually gave her $120 because of ATM withdrawal) A little after this time my gf asked what we were gonna do after prom and I said I didn't know, she was kinda distraught that she wasn't going to be able to hang out with me after prom at all and I realized it was kinda fucked so at this point I told Eileen I'd go down Sunday morning (after spending Saturday night with gf) and I'd find a ride down to the shore house. I also needed to do a presentation Wednesday so I said I'd get a ride back late Monday night with one of the other people who are going back Monday night (there's lots). No problems there.\\n\\nFast forward to February, Eileen requests $118 ($120 again due to ATM withdrawal)again along with $70 for food and alcohol. She said this was the last payment and I was fine with that, albeit hesitant about paying that much for alcohol since I'm not a heavy drinker. \\n\\nWell, a few weeks ago, she says we need to pay $54 each for the bus. I figure I'd get a discounted rate since I'm only going from the pre-prom location to prom in the bus, the rest I'm gonna do myself. She told me nope and that it's $54 for both my girlfriend and I even though neither of us are taking the bus to the actual prom house (the extent of the cost). Now I was pretty upset about this not gonna lie. \\n\\nSo it's the week before prom and I got surgery Monday and the results came back that I can't drink at all this weekend so I asked Eileen to re-apportion my alcohol money to food instead. She said it was too late for that and I still needed to pay for the bus. The problem here is that the food we have is very minimal, only easy mac, ramen and various snacks and water. No burgers, no hot dogs, no nothing. Yet there are 28 people in the prom house and we gave her $70 EACH for alcohol AND food. Plus there's at least one other person who hasn't paid for the bus yet and he told me she hasn't said anything to him. He's also closer friends-wise with her, although when I brought it up she did say he would have to pay for the bus. But he's a heavy drinker and using the bus to get down to the shore house. Then she said if I refused to pay for the bus I would have to formally apologize in the Facebook group because she wouldn't have enough money to buy food that people want.\\n\\nAt this point I had an outburst because I said the food should have already been covered at this point and my bus money should have nothing to do with that, and that I'm already paying for alcohol which I won't be drinking, 3 nights for the house when I'll only be staying for 1; and now a bus I'd only use for a 15 minute ride from pre-prom to the actual prom event. \\n\\nOh also she suggested the idea of having her college Freshman friends come down to drink with us and then drive some people back Tuesday morning. This angered me too because she's cool with allowing them to come down whenever but not my significant other when I've deposited all this money already.\\n\\nAnyway Reddit I'll be happy to clarify anything for you to determine if I'm the asshole or not. Should I drive my date to prom in my car? Should I pay her and suck it up? Should I continue to insist my way on to the bus for 15 minutes without paying? \\n\\nEdit: Forgot this bit -  Apparently she did some mismanagement with money and some people gave her less than she had asked for in some cases but she never counted. If I'm supposed to feel bad for her fronting money because she didn't keep track of the expenses and the amount she was given - I don't. I'm not going to cover anyone else and I think it should be fair that I get to go to the bus for prom at least. She said at the start of all this it would be $220-230 per person for the house if we had 24 people; currently we have 28 and it was $236 per person for just the house.\\n\\n\\nEdit 2: oh and earlier in the year she told me stories about how she overcharged people for alcohol since she had a fake and it was easy. \", 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA for getting mad about prom house management?

He told me in no uncertain terms that I was wrong. He told me he did not understand how I could feel sad, and that I had no right to feel that way over language. I tried very hard to explain that my feelings about it were not necessarily based in logic, and that I was just confused as to how this word could now mean something entirely the opposite.

I deleted him of Facebook and haven't contacted him since. \\nI know that I am in a healthier place than him emotionally,  and I had always cut him extra slack for that.

Sorta, because I don't actually pursue anyone, or even develope serious crushes. I mostly do it because I want to make friends, and theater is fun.\\n\\nThis happened during the second show I did over there, which was without the guy who introduced me to their theater program. I mention this because I was pretty uncomfortable with (mostly) different people than the musical, and ended up spending most of my time at practice with the guy I'd brought over from my school. While he was onstage I'd sit around on my side of the aud, reading my script or a book, maybe doing homework or just watching the scene. \\n\\nSo This Girl, who had approached me occasionally during practice for the last show, calls me over to her and group of friends, and tells me to stop being antisocial. I complied, and ended up having a great time talking to her, and some people I'd sorta known before. This marked the beginning of much more comfort around people in this show, and making a lot more friends there. \\n\\n**IMPORTANT BIT, SKIP HERE IF NECESSARY**\\n\\nI decided, kind of arbitrarily I guess, that I wanted to go to my school's valentines day date dance. I was originally going to ask another girl I sorta knew, but then the above happened and. I started to notice this Girl more, she was pretty, nice to me, all that stuff, so I asked her instead. I was very nervous, because I'd developed a bit of a crush on her, but she says no... For schedule reasons, but then yes later that night at a mutual friends birthday party. We spent that night not talking, besides her saying yes, and once when she offered to bring me a bowl of candy from the candy bar (thanks?).\\n\\nDance comes, it's a good time, we go back to pretty normal relations though, maybe a little awkward on both ends. Then we start talking again, she lends me a book to read,  I gove her a comic book I'd read (she likes, them I hate them so I told her she could keep it, and it was a bit of an awkward crush gift). We talk a lot about the book, smile at eachother during practice, everything's going well.\\n\\nBefore she leaves the cast party, she tells me to email her (she doesn't have a phone). No really, EMAIL ME!\\n\\nJeez, fine. That's a good thing, right? \\n\\nLeaving details out (differences available on request) I got to know her a bit better, but I just didn't like her all that much. She's a nice girl, she did absolutely nothing wrong, but I don't like her anymore. I never ignored her, but I didn't give any hints I was interested. We weren't actually dating or anything, I think, so I couldn't exactly break up with her. \\n\\nWe saw eachother at a dance, which we planned with a few other people to attend. Going over convos. I'd had with her friends, at least one of them considered us nearly a couple. The other spent the whole dance pestering me about whether I liked Girl, or Other Girl, or Anyone, which was frustrating. I told her no to other girl, and I don't know to all other questions. Gah. Her other friend told me soon after that Girl had a big crush on me.\\n\\nGirl was just not fun to talk to, I felt like I was entertaining her and just didn't like all that much. So the conversation through email fizzled out, deapite her being very enthusiatic throughout, and she no longer emails me. \\n\\n\\n\\n\", 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': \"AITA For 'changing my mind' about a crush?\", 'url': 'http://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/38z9wo/aita_for_changing_my_mind_about_a_crush/'}, {'author': '[deleted]', 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'created_utc': 1433735437, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/38zj2l/aita_for_seeking_an_oncam_fuck_buddy_and_getting/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '38zj2l', 'is_self': True, 'link_flair_css_class': 'not', 'link_flair_text': 'not the asshole', 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 10, 'over_18': True, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/38zj2l/aita_for_seeking_an_oncam_fuck_buddy_and_getting/', 'retrieved_on': 1440684851, 'score': 0, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': 'Throwaway name for security reasons. \\n\\nI admittedly have a high libido and currently being without a boyfriend or even a fuck buddy has made my sex drive even crazier.

She later admitted it was out of spite for really liking me previously. We\\'ll call her Rebecca.\\n\\nSo two years later, I meet and really like this chick who eventually became the second candidate for the asshole in question. We\\'ll call her Samantha. I flirted with Sam, and she didn\\'t exactly respond negatively. I primarily liked Sam for her physical features. Looking back, she never turned down any attempts at touching her (nothing sexual, just flirty). She never really flirted directly, as she has an immature personality, which I\\'d found attractive at the time. After about 8 months to a year of this, I still don\\'t pick up a clue that she likes me, so I decide I need to move on without even talking to her about it. So I find a new girlfriend that I like for her personality, but not so much her looks. We\\'ll call her Adaline. About a week into dating Adaline, and Sam texts me. A little bit further into the conversation and Sam states she liked me the whole time and was waiting for me to ask her out. I\\'m initially extremely excited that my dream girl liked me the whole time. So we make plans for me to break up with my girlfriend and for us to go out. I justify it in my own head that this is fine as I like Sam more and therefore it is fair that I break Adaline\\'s heart. Sam\\'s so initially excited she draws pictures of us cuddling while Adaline and I are still dating. I eventually come to my senses and realize this is utterly wrong and unfair of me to do this to Adaline. I tell Sam that I\\'m going to continue dating Adaline and not allow her to influence that. This pisses her off, and we don\\'t speak for 5 months.\\n\\nAdaline was the best girlfriend I\\'ve ever had, so kind and generous in nature. I was most certainly the asshole in the situation with her, and wish I could make it up to her (but she doesn\\'t want any part of me). After the 5 month period, Sam and I talk once again. I don\\'t exactly remember why or how it began. But it eventually led me to believe that she was worth ditching Adaline for. So I broke up with Adaline and talked to Sam. Sam said she wanted to wait a bit before her and I went out, like maybe 2 weeks so that it didn\\'t seem as though I broke up with Adaline for Sam (even tho thats exactly why). So on the Friday of the first week of the one week period, I must take my important finals.

To begin with, I live overseas and in general I’ve been more of an individual who values strong friendships in small numbers rather than having a great number of contacts.\\n\\nTo keep it short I befriended some new coworkers. For the most part I tried approaching the situation in clear conscience and did my best to build healthy ties, and for the most part as did the other two people. However I found that over time it started to feel like a 1 way relationships. While I was always welcoming and open with invitations for things like coffee or food they would, 95% of the time go un answered. I didn’t think much of it simply due to the fact I go for coffee and dinner on a whim quite regularly and I don’t expect people to fit my schedule, especially one that is so unplanned.\\n\\nThat being said, after a few months of me taking time out to build a friendship I realized almost all of my invitations went unanswered. To be fair, I didn’t really bring this up and at the time it only started to crop up a bit but didn’t concern me much.\\n\\nFlash forward a bit and I was invited by the two coworkers for a event at a local amusement park. I said I’d come but on the actual morning I actually kind of caved. I don’t really know how to explain it but I guess the stress of constantly having to be out and involved as an introvert the previous months combined with the fact I was living in a foreign country and putting a lot of pressure on myself lead to me curled up in bed the entire day. It wasn't my proudest morning and I have to say with all the time I've spent here it was probably my weakest.\\n\\nIn all fairness I didn’t give a warning, didn’t even check my phone, didn’t respond. I simply shut the curtains and spent the next 2 days curled up in my bed. I’m sure it was stress, I don’t really know, all I know is that it was something that happened, and I really really needed it.\\n\\nOf course I felt like shit about it and didn’t have the confidence to even check my phone for the two days following. When I eventually did check my phone all I saw was 2 messages, asking where I was, and if I was coming.\\n\\nFor the record I didn’t do this for attention or any sort of affirmation or anything like that but at the same time I created a clearer picture (or so I think) of where the relationship actually stood.\\n\\nFollowing that incident, neither of them particularly acknowledged it, in turn neither did I and simply from there we went from talking normally to having no contact in the work place, in or out. This has continued to this day. Of course some other coworkers have confronted me on me and them are no longer friends but neither I nor the previous friends have made any effort to get past that whole silence.\\n\\nIt’s at the point of comfort now but I try to self analyze my situations in life quite a bit.

It's a bit older than I've been playing and ever since I started, I've wanted this rare costume set. It was big when a little noob but I've only been able to get the necessary in game money to purchase them a year ago. They were one of the first sets to enter the game and they're next to impossible to find now. My SO's decked out in its polar opposite, same scenario. He had wanted his set ever since he started and he's been watching the market like a hawk for the pieces. I found out that he and a friend had also been watching for the pieces that I wanted. A little while previously, they had an event where you could wear the full set I wanted for a single day. I ran around in it, enjoyed it, found that I liked the look and feel of the cheap costume that I had been wearing up until then better, and generally let my craving wash away. I told my SO this, but it seems to have slipped his memory. I first realized that he and our friend were watching the market for the pieces when they rushed excitedly to me to announce that someone was selling the top part of the costume. There are 6 costume pieces and two accessory pieces. The accessories are wonderfully expensive and completely out of my price range, the top part, bottom part, gloves, and shoes are feasible. The hair part and weapon I never expected to get. I never planned to wear the set unless I had the weapon part or else it would break up the current set that I have. All in all, I considered it a pointless endeavor. When my SO came to tell me about the piece on sale, I told him to forget about it. I didn't have enough money at the time to buy it anyway, but he did. He told me over and over to get one but I refused. Eventually after I had gone to sleep for the night, he logged onto my account, transferred the money, and bought the item. I thought, what the hell, might as well go for it now. We managed to get the gloves and shoes, but his enthusiasm dropped after that. He used to watch the board constantly for it, but now doesn't care about it at all and I learned from others that the bottom part had come for sale but it was long gone. I searched halfheartedly on my own with no luck. Now a new costume set has come and I want to attempt obtaining, but when I mentioned to my SO that I wanted to sell the costume he got for me to get it, he got upset. I told him that I hadn't wanted that costume before he got it for me nor did I want it afterwards. He had been the one truly excited about it but he puttered out and now it's rotting in my inventory. He told me that he thought I was refusing to purchase the top in the first place because I had wanted to try to get it on my own. \\n\\nI feel like an asshole but sometimes I just want to toss the costume on the floor and walk away from it.

I wasn't sure what to do, but I was horny, she was horny, we both were tipsy. So we had fun that night.\\n\\nFast forward to today, we were messaging each other a bit and she still thinks that I'm bloody handsome. I'm a bit unsure what to do.

I want to know at least half of the story and regardless of what she is telling me, I want her to end the relationship. Either that or I'm leaving. Easy as that. \\n\\nFor anyone wondering what led me to that decision: \\n\\nHe could be too much of a nice guy. I still don't care about the status of their relationship or their relationship in general. I don't think I'm the one ruining it, it's already ruined. All the comments about how a relationship needs to be taken care of and somehow I'm also obligated to do that are nonsense. Specially this kind of relationship. I don't think my action forms me to an asshole or that I'm somehow unable to love anyone anymore. The only thing that got me thinking is, if this guy is just a nice guy, I would be sorry for him. Sorry for him to be in this situation with a girlfriend who doesn't love him as much as he does. \\n\\nAs it stands, I'm the asshole, probably a sexless asshole. Thanks for that guys...\\n\\nlast late edit: Just in case someone is stumbling over this thread the conclusion is: they broke up. He was kinda nice, but they had huge problems from the beginning. She just wasn't able to take it anymore, no physical harm, just never a secure or happy relationship. She is full of regret, more so than I am I have to admit. If she had the chance to revert her actions, she would have ended it far earlier. I still meet her, quite often actually and it's possible that this will lead to somewhere. If you read my comments down there, you may have a bad picture of me, rightfully so. I'm a bonehead who defeats his point even after proven wrong and it reads as I have no empathy what so ever. I even wrote I don't want to be a relationship with her... Looking back, I should have done things differently, but I can't change the past, so I'm living with my decisions and with the words I've written. I won't delete anything, although I hope she never finds this thread. Why I'm writing this here?

There is this one girl on the team... We can call her Becky. Now Becky and I have been friends since before each of us joined the team, however Becky has one flaw, she is a flirtatious person. I know that might not seem so bad but in this case yes, Becky flirts with everyone and I mean everyone on our boys team (myself included)  now Becky claims to actually like like me which I'm not that comfortable with seeing her flirt with others and even more, if you catch my drift.

In the past, whenever we spoke, he was always out doing open houses, etc. But he hasn\\'t seemed very active with it lately. (Granted, I never asked him if he was still actively selling real estate.)\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nThe issue: I recently sold my house. My fiancé and I did not want to use my dad as my real estate agent for various reasons (listed below). I was uncomfortable telling my dad upfront (again, I have my reasons) so I kind of avoided the whole situation.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nWe listed the house and sold it within 8 days. My father found out after the fact and called me about it. Conversation went like this:\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nDad: \"You already sold your house?\"\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nMe: \"Yes, dad. Remember, I mentioned it a few months ago that we\\'d be selling the place?\"\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nDad: \"Yeah, I assumed you were going to use me as your agent. You know what? **You’re dead to me!**\"\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nMe: \"What?! Dad, c\\'mon! We decided to use Juan\\'s (my fiancé’s) friend who gave us a break on the commission.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nDad: \"I already told all my friends that I was going to help my daughter sell her place. You can never count on your family and friends when you need them! I gotta go.\"\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nAnd he hung up on me. We haven\\'t spoken in almost two months.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nHe literally said the words, \"You\\'re dead to me\". I was so hurt! But I refuse to be the one to reach out first, since I\\'m “dead” in his eyes. Plus, I don\\'t think I\\'ve done anything wrong. I feel that what I do with my house and my finances is my business.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nI spoke to my younger half-sister about what happened. She couldn’t believe he would say something like that. She spoke to my dad and he confirmed it. He also confirmed that he was upset about the money (the money he would have made with the commission).\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nReasons I didn’t want to use my dad: I used my dad as my agent when I bought my place 7 years ago. He made his full commission off of me, which is fine (I guess). Although, I know if my mother were the agent, she wouldn’t have wanted to make any money off of me. Anyway, my father treated me like I received the family discount instead of as a real client. He wasn’t responsive and I felt like I couldn’t really ask all the questions that I would normally ask another agent. Plus, my father lives 40 miles away and doesn’t really know the neighborhood and area like a local agent would. The agent we ended up using this time around was awesome! The commission was discounted (used Redfin) and he knew his stuff!\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nA little more background: My parents divorced when I was 4 and I’ve never really been close to my father. My older brother doesn’t speak to him at all, and before this, I spoke to him rarely (maybe once a month). Granted, I really should have grown some balls and told my father ahead of time that I wasn’t using him. But I don’t have that type of relationship with him.

I need some strangers to tell it like it is.  \\n  \\nI'm a taxi driver. A middle aged man approached my window and asked if I could take his three companions to a local hotel. They were younger than him and from the way they were talking sounded like they may have been his employees.  When I agreed he asked the price, £3.50 (very short journey). He handed me a £20 note, asked me to take care of them and walked away without another word. I drove them to the hotel, full of glee at my 600% tip.  \\n  \\nYou may now see where this is going. I pulled up at the hotel, said my goodbyes and waited for the three to climb out. After a short pause one of the three asked for the change.  Now, I'm quite an agreeable fellow, I'm very polite and do my job well. I would rather be slightly out of pocket to help keep the peace in any other situation, but in my opinion this was my money, given to me with no further instructions to pass it on to anyone else. If the paying gentlemen wanted me to give the change to his companions he should have made it clear, when someone gives a person in the service industry a note and then walks away, that's language for 'this is your tip'.  \\n  \\nAnyway, I told the young man that there was no change, there were no instructions to give the change to him. A ten minute stand off ensued, during which they tried to phone the paying guy. I told them that if he said to give them the change I gladly would, but in the end they couldn't reach him. All three of them were visibly aghast at the stance I was taking, it culminated with them all at my window, the girl in the group screaming at me to give them the money. No, it was my money, not theirs. They asked for a receipt which I gave them, writing '£20 received, with thanks' (ok, I'm definitely an asshole for that, but I was really wound up by this point). They left, very angry. I expected to get a call from my office, our number was on the card, but I never heard anything else about it.  \\n  \\nAs this was all happening I wasn't completely sure I was in the right, but I felt it was a matter of principle and dug my heels in. It has haunted me slightly ever since.

The large majority of the time the job is divided into two parts  - two of my teammates make sure the orders are correct in our database and one of my teammates and I enter the orders from our database into the national chain\\'s database.  \\n\\nLast summer, there started being a lot of errors in the accounts in our database.  All little things that are supposed to be corrected before the accounts get to me.  The problem got worse and worse and one day early last fall, I mentioned it to my two teammates.  They said they weren\\'t aware they were missing things and would be more attentive.  Nothing changed.  The other person who primarily does what I do hadn\\'t been so great at catching the mistakes and eventually the errors were reported to our supervisor.  She asked me to keep a list of errors I was seeing and send it to her.  I did.  She said she would talk to the teammate who was making the most mistakes but didn\\'t know what else she could do.  Nothing changed.\\n\\nI kept my mouth shut and just continued to fix problems.  In April this year, I realized I was fixing problems in over 20% of the accounts I touched.

Here\\'s a list of the stuff I\\'ve been fixing this week so you\\'ll know what to be on the lookout for.\"  And I included a long list of the problems I had fixed that week, minus the names of the person responsible for each one.  I didn\\'t want to embarrass anyone, I just wanted us to perform the way I knew we could.\\n\\nPeople\\'s feelings were hurt.  They thought I was saying that they were the worst teammates on the planet and that I was making judgments about them personally.  I got the silent treatment, I got emails pointing out that I wasn\\'t perfect (even though I never asked anyone to be perfect), I was told that a 20% error rate was the best they could do and that they were too busy to even think about making any changes.  Their defensiveness escalated to a point where I really had to stop being nice and start being bluntly honest about how bad things had been for the last year.  That made things worse and after that, I did do some assholish things like stop socializing with them and only answering work-related questions, leaving at the end of my shift without saying goodbye, etc.\\n\\nIt was so frustrating.  It felt like they were saying that their time was too valuable to be using 3 seconds to double-check their work for errors, but it\\'s perfectly fine to make me spend my time doing it.  They know I will always fix their problems, because if I don\\'t, we both get in trouble.  And I\\'m a fucking team player.  \\n\\nTo be effective, we need to work as a team, so eventually I just said whatever and told them I would adjust my expectations and let it go.\\n\\nSince then, the problem has progressively gotten worse.

It\\'s not hard to see a car head on in front of you. I got pissed about this, smaller their arm when we were safe in the parking lot.

They also wouldn\\'t take it seriously on how upset I was and how I\\'d never go looking for their throwaways because I actually respected their privacy and stuff.

We got married abroad (international relationship). We came back to Canada last summer, she got her spouse visa in the fall, and she got a job in spring. \\n\\nThen right after she got the job, she wants a separation.. \"to get to know herself better or some BS\" Now she\\'s been freaking out and going over the top. She\\'s really shown her true colors. I see her on friday before work, then not again until sunday night. I\\'m fucking sick of this shit.\\n\\nNow, the part that may give me power/make me an asshole. A part of her visa stipulates that we MUST live together for 2 years after arriving (and getting her Visa) it\\'s hasn\\'t even been a year. I don\\'t think she knows this. I told her well before we came to Canada, maybe she forgot. If I report her (or anyone does) she risks losing her VISA and getting deported back to her home country.\\n\\nBUT, On the other hand, if I DON\\'T report her or whatever, I am financially responsible for her for 3 years (which would make sense for a happily married couple..) but I don\\'t want to be in that position. We haven\\'t even been married for 2 years yet. \\n\\nSo, I\\'m all for the divorce. She\\'s a bitch, she\\'s trying to ruin my life now, and I (at the very least) don\\'t want to be on the hook for this woman...\\n\\nWhat do!?!\\n\\n[EDIT]\\n\\nIt seems there are some comments that I haven\\'t painted the whole picture, and that may be true indeed. But I didn\\'t want to write my memoirs on here. I tried to give the basics without going into too much detail. Basically, our relationship started out with a lot of trust issues. Communication was always a bit of a problem, seeing we we had different first languages. She lied to me about seeing a guy at a bar, it was innocent, but the fact she had to lie and never apologized about it was rather disappointing.\\n\\nFast forward, we get married (things are not perfect, but no signs of major cracks) She stops having sex with me (this was the reason for this throwaway account.. i was lurking on /r/deadbedrooms), doing basic chores, just \\'existing\\' but all the while critizising me. I suggest we go to counseling (for the third time. when I brought it up before she was aggressive and hesitant but claimed that she willing to go so long as I did all the leg work (basically she said she\\'d show up).\\n\\nWe did go (after arriving in Canada), showed no willingness to work together and try. She refused to communicate with me, tell me what she is feeling. She says she wants to stop wearing her wedding ring (now that she finally found a job). She said it was because it was \"uncomfortable\" or didn\\'t want a tan line (since it was spring/summer). When finally i got it out of her, it was she wanted a separation.\\n\\nAnd so, here we are today. Her sexual neglect (and my inability to cope with it..?) and our terrible communication lead to the destruction of our marriage. If she married me only to come to Canada... then idk what the fuck to do.\\nI just don\\'t want to get into shit.\\n\\nAs an aside, I have spoken to our immigration lawyer who we used to process her visa.

I am 19 years old.\\n\\nMy friend Jeremy had a new years eve party at his house. His younger sister, Gretchen, had a few friends over as well but since they were juniors in high school at the time and we were in college, they weren\\'t around us most of the night. I am pretty  drunk by the end of the night, and Gretchen\\'s best friend Lola decided to ditch her young friends and join the partying college kids. Lola and I hit it off, and we are talking for a long period of time. She shows me her tattoo, we talk about how hard it is to find jeans that fit properly (we are both quite tall), the whole bit. I wake up the next morning and Lola is gone, and I was kinda disappointed. \\n\\nI get a text from Gretchen saying that Lola wants my number, she was just too nervous to ask for it the night before. I oblige, and we start texting. She starts getting very serious about things and wants to hang out really bad and asks how serious we are and where this is going (which I am fine with, and I find very attractive actually)I am then informed that she is only 16 years old, and I realize that a relationship isn\\'t going to work if I have to go back for spring semester in a week. And even after that, she\\'s still in another year of high school. So I tell her that unfortunately I can\\'t do the long distance thing, especially from college to high school. We are at different points in our lives and have different priorities. She is extremely understanding, and very cool about it. Then a few weeks later, she texts me and asks to hang out one weekend that I\\'m home. I politely decline and say something would happen between us, and then I would have to leave again for school and it would be too hard. She says, and I quote,\\n\\n \"pantherlax56 I\\'m not trying to start a relationship, I just want to hang out with you.\"\\n\\nI again politely decline the offer. She texts me intermittently after that, and I say maybe we can get together over the summer when I\\'m home for while. She says that sounds good. The texting pretty much cuts off a few days later.\\n\\nFast forward to the summer. Im home from school, and I\\'m ready to party with my friends I haven\\'t seen in awhile. So my other friend, Richard, invites me over to his house for some beers. We watch F1 qualifying, and start talking about girls. As it happens, Richard and Lola are good friends. He tells me that she has been talking about me non stop, and he repeatedly told her \\n\\n\"you guys will be a thing over the summer just wait\"\\n\\n because he couldn\\'t deal with her constant mentions of me. We\\'re both pretty drunk, and he says, \\n\\n\"hey dude, its Lola\\'s birthday today. If you wanna make someone\\'s day, text her.\"\\n\\n So I do. We pretty much pick up right where we left off and things start getting hot and heavy pretty quick. We start making sexual innuendos on a daily basis, talking about \"studying extra hard\" for her finals and making sure she\\'s \"extra prepared\" for her male reproductive system test (she\\'s in nursing classes). I think to myself: \\n\\n1. I expressed my feelings about a relationship awhile ago, and she understood\\n2. She told me she didn\\'t want a relationship either, just to hang out\\n3. We are talking very sexually within days of talking to each other for the first time in months\\n\\nAnd I conclude that we both want a casual hookup FWB type thing. So I ask to hang out, she says sure. I ask if we can hang out at her place, she says there is \"nowhere to go\" (furthering my assumptions of a casual sex thing). So I say she can come over to my house and we can \"study.\" She says sounds great. She comes over, we have sex, she goes home. I get a text from Lola that says, \\n\\n\"so what does this mean?\" \\n\\nand I ask, \\n\\n\"what do you mean, what does this mean?\"\\n\\n\"are we casual or is this going anywhere?\" she asks.\\n\\nI explain that I made an assumption based on what I thought were obvious clues, and I apologize, but my feelings about having a relationship with someone far away and still in high school haven\\'t changed in 2 months. I apologize profusely, and reiterate the fact that we already talked about not being in a relationship and just hanging out. I thought I knew what that meant, but I was wrong. She gets very upset, and doesn\\'t talk to me.\\n\\nI have now come to find out that Lola explained (in graphic detail) what her and I did to Jeremy and Gretchen\\'s parents. My best friend\\'s mother apparently said that I \"hit it and quit it.\" So the next time I was over at Jeremy\\'s, it was terribly awkward because Lola, Gretchen, and Jeremy\\'s parents were all there. Everyone knew that we had sex, and then just quit talking. \\n\\nLola hates me, Gretchen thinks I\\'m a \"fuckboi\", and her parents think I intentionally \"hit it and quit it.\"\\n\\nAm I an asshole for assuming what I did?\\n\\nEDIT: I left  a few things out of the original story in the interest of keeping it short. When we met, I was 18, she was 16. When we had sex, we were both a year older (19 and 17 respectively). I didn\\'t just cease communication with her as soon as I pulled out, as some seem to think. I simply meant that it was very awkward between us due to the miscommunication, and she made it clear that she didn\\'t want anything to do with me anymore. \\n\\nAlso, if I could defend myself a bit: Sex is an act that involves at least two people. If she didn\\'t want to, she could have said/let on that she wasn\\'t into it. But I know that she wanted to, because she initiated it physically. I won\\'t get into the gory details but she definitely started and continued to enable the act of foreplay/intercourse. This was also the first time we hung out in person, just the two of us. I don\\'t know about you all, but if I plan on starting a relationship with someone, I probably wouldn\\'t have sex with them on the first \"date\" or whatever you might call our little hangout mesh.\\n\\nEDIT 2: I would like to clarify that 16 is the age of consent in my state. Regardless of your moral standings, I am in the clear legally.

We either plan a meetup there or we just talk about random stuff. This guy I'm referring to in the title is a guy who I've known for years. Quiet as fuck on social occasions, socially awkward and always a little behind. He's often by himself alone at home and playing video games or something. Doesn't always understand simple stuff, his logic is off many times but other than that he's just a regular guy. \\n\\nWith his background in mind I'm going to tell you what has happened. When this guy is in a bad mood or if we've called him out on being stupid about something (not in a bad way but I understand that from his perspection it may seem like we're acting more smart than him and that makes him feel dumb) time passes by and when you say something normal he just says Shut Up (most of the time, sometimes he says other stuff) to me (not the other guys for the most part). It annoys me so much because there is no reason for saying that to your friends. Keep in mind that when we call him out we only explain the more logical way of thinking but like I previously said that probably sounds like we're mean to him from his perspective. Also because we're more people against him alone. \\n\\nAnyways this last night he said ''Gay'' to one of my normal texts in the chat randomly. I replied ''Don't be an old granny (referring to being bitter) and type Shut Up, it shows thay you're bitter and moody'' (he had been saying that previously this night). He replies with ''Gay'' again. I tell him that he acts like a little kid and has no logic. He replies with ''Eat poop''. Saying stuff like this could be funny when you were like 15 but we've grown out of it, except he hasn't. The words he usually uses are Shut Up though. When I call him out on acting like a kid he often says that he's just joking. It's obvious that he isn't and that he just lets out his inner aggression feelings on me in this chat when he's having a bad day.\\n\\nI want to know if I'm the asshole here since I feel like a bully sometimes because he's all alone in his opinions and actions while I have backup from my friends. I'd more importantly would like to know how to handle the situation going forward. Preferably a way to make him stop being a bitch and not by just cutting him off as a friend like I imagine most of you will say. Calling him out in chat doesn't seem to work but when we meet in real life he's quiet as usual which is also annoying. Be a man and say it to my face for fucks sake.

I\\'m a long time lurker and hope I can get some honest advice. \\nTo give a little background my boyfriend and I just graduated high school together and have been with each other for about a year now. He\\'s always been pretty against me going to parties or touching anything other than weed(I smoke regularly and since our relationship has gone on hes gotten quite into it himself.) And I\\'ve done my best to respect that and have bitten my tongue countless times because he\\'s told me \"I can\\'t\" go do things or be around certain people because he doesn\\'t approve for some reason, or he\\'s jealous of them. I\\'ve tried acid and shrooms once and have experimented with painkillers and alcohol pretty heavily in the past. I ended up getting arrested and really saw my life for what it was, moved hours away, quit drinking and experimenting, mended my bad relationships with my family, graduated a year early, and am enrolled in college next semester. I\\'m so much happier with myself and don\\'t really see the need to try other things that I know will harm my body becuase theres more to life than getting fucked up. Hes told me in the past that he\\'s not comfortable with the drugs ive done and that he would break up with me without a  second thought if I ever touched cocaine or acid, which I think is pretty reasonable. I don\\'t exactly want him into those things either. He\\'s recently found a new group of friends and says he doesn\\'t want me around them because, they\\'re \"not accepting people\" and even had a birthday party that he didn\\'t tell me about or invite me to with all of them the other day. A few daya ago he told me that he wanted to try cocaine and that we should do it together. I am not comfortable with cocaine at all and told him that. He says his friends were on it a few days before and they just looked so happy. I said I wasn\\'t really comfortable with his friends doing cocaine around him. Last night he was staying over and his friend called him and asked him to come try cocaine, this made me very uncomfortable and I said \"I\\'m not sure if I like your friends, they seem like bad influences on you and I know you\\'d tell me the same thing. I\\'m just not comfortable with it.\" He starts to ignore me even being in the room until he finally tells me that I way too judgmental and that he\\'s not staying at my house. I offered to let him sleep in my bed and I\\'d go on the couch and we could drop the situation right now. I beg him to just talk to me about it while he literally completely ignores my presence until saying that \"talking never works\" and things to that nature. I tried to stress that communication is pretty much the most important thing in a relationship and that we obviously need to talk about this problem. I said what I said because I\\'m not comfortable with hard drugs and feel like he\\'s choosing his friends over me not because I\\'m trying to be judgemental. He then left with the friends that called him and probably did cocaine. \\nTL;DR boyfriend who was against drugs gets a call and decides he wants to go do cocaine. That\\'s a little shady and I say that. I\\'m mean and judgmental and should beg him to come back.

I was extremely close with the one (we\\'ll call her Kay), and good friends with the other two (we\\'ll call them Ali and Jess).  Ali is the friend I\\'m talking about now.  After we graduated we all went off to colleges in different states and slowly grew apart.  Jess dropped off the face of the earth completely, and I vaguely kept in email contact with Kay and Ali.  Ali dropped out and moved back home, but she worked really hard and has an awesome job, so she\\'s been doing well.  I never thought I\\'d move back even remotely close to where I grew up, but I ended up going to graduate school about 2 hours away from where I grew up, and I reconnected with Ali.  We grew up in a small town, so she always wanted to come visit me to come to the big city, and I would visit her occasionally, but not nearly as often as she would come to see me.  Typically her visits involved her going to some event, like a concert or sporting event and she would crash at my place.\\n\\n\\nSo the start of the fall out started a few years ago when I was diagnosed with cancer.  I was really sick and in the hospital and I talked to her about visiting, she said she was slammed at work and couldn\\'t make it, but she sent a card and a gift.  No big deal, I totally understood.  Fast forward about six months, she came into town to visit, I was on the mend.  We go out to lunch and I was telling her how hard everything had been, she says now that I\\'ve opened up she should as well.  That she had been lying about being single for all these years, and that she\\'d actually had a boyfriend for about two years.  She said the reason she hadn\\'t told me was because it was scandalous, and I was thinking maybe he was married or something.  Then she tells me its because he\\'s black.  I found this really offensive, because I could care less about that, and if she knew me at all she would know that.  I brought up that Jess is black and dated white guys and none of us thought anything of that, so why would this be any different.  She was like oh well I just didn\\'t know if you were racist or not.  So I was already mad, but then she tells me that she\\'s been coming to town about every week with him to go to events and stuff, but never told me because she didn\\'t want me to know about him.  So she didn\\'t come visit me when I was in the hospital with cancer because she didn\\'t want me to know about her secret black boyfriend.\\n\\n\\nThe second strike is our beach trip a few months later.  We had already planned and paid for it when I found this out, so I decided to suck it up and try to make it as fun as possible.  We go out one night, I drove and was DD, she proceeds to get trashed, and cause a scene at the bar we were at.  She invited two guys back to our place even though we both have boyfriends, and I had to tell them they were not actually invited and to leave us alone, and she starts yelling at me about how I\\'m such a worrier and that nothing was going to happen and I\\'m no fun, etc etc.  I drove us back to our condo and I was pissed.  I mostly read on the beach the next day, and I didn\\'t drive us to go back out, and then I went straight home.  \\n\\n\\nStrike three for me was kinda two things together, but they were similar.  The first was her coming to visit to go to something during the day and wanted me to go with her, I told her I had to work and couldn\\'t.  I worked all day and then went out that night, and she thought this was rude because I said I couldn\\'t hang out.  Then I was supposed to see her before Thanksgiving and ended up having to work, I warned her a week in advance that I wouldn\\'t be able to make it, and she told me to text her the day of to confirm.  I said ok, but then I forgot, because I was focused on work, and at 4pm she texted me and said \"I guess you\\'re not coming\" I told her that I had already let her know and was going to text her when I got home.  I apologized and said that maybe I didn\\'t come across clear, but that I thought I had let her know.  She said that our friendship doesn\\'t seem like a priority to me and that I\\'m a shitty friend.  So I told her if that\\'s how she feels then great, but I don\\'t care because I\\'m done being friends with someone who treats me the way that she does.

Let\\'s call him Bryant.\\n\\nBryant and I were close because of our shared interests. He liked video games and I liked video games, but it all started to go down hill when we became juniors. Around the beginning of that year, I got a girlfriend. Being a relationship noob of sorts, I didn\\'t know how to manage time and essentially say \\'no.\\' to both my friends and my new girlfriend. After 3 months, the relationship ended and my friendships suffered.\\n\\nAfter this, a month of hanging out with other people had lessened the tensions with my original group of friends, and I had rejoined them. Just like I assume friends argue sometimes, we argued, but the arguments would always end with how I abandoned my friends for a girl. I felt pretty bad, but everyone got over it.\\n\\nCome senior year and another friend got a girlfriend, a whole new set of drama for us nerds to be angry about. Time passes.\\n\\nNow Bryant isn\\'t having a good home life. We try to encourage him to hang out with us, and since I care(at least I think I do) I was pretty angry about the things going on in his home. He felt trapped, so it only made sense that we try to keep him around and spend time with him.\\n\\nHe rejected our invites and, once we stopped asking him to hang out, he became sad and angry, thinking we don\\'t want to be friends with him. Now, random things set him off and he often leaves facebook groups/skype chats and blocks everyone on social networks.\\n\\nHe usually comes back after a while, but every time he leaves the reason becomes more ridiculous.

They hate Jesus, but they hate us even more now. Don\\'t you know they execute homosexuals?\"\\n\\nI simply respond by saying that true muslims do not hate Jesus. They in fact recognize him as a prophet much like Jewish people recognize him as a prophet, just not as their messiah.\\n\\nAnyways, we get into it about how Muslims and Jews don\\'t follow the \"one true path in Christ\" and how \"I\\'d be surprised how many jews hate Christians.\" I did a bit of quick research and posted a rather lengthy response that reads:\\n\\n\\n\"You\\'d be surprised how many Christians hate other Christians.\\n\\n\\nEverything that you read in the New Testament about Jesus and Moses and any link between the two is not going to affect the views of a born, raised, and practicing Jewish person. In their hearts, Jewish people believe that they have been following the teachings of Moses (the 5 books) and that the Messiah has yet to come. For them, Jesus was not the Messiah. There are a lot of vague things that may be interpreted in many ways in every religious text, which is why we get extremist groups that seek to destroy other religions and only seek the betterment of their own religion. This vagueness also accounts for the writings of Moses about the Messiah and why Jewish people refuse to accept Jesus as the Messiah. Jesus says in the new testament that Moses talked about him, but he was never directly named or mentioned by Moses. It was left up to an entire religion to determine what Moses meant when he gave the conditions for the prophecy. \\n\\nAnyway, the three monotheistic religions teach about Abraham and his descendants. They also teach about prayer and dedicating ones\\' life to its teachings. The difference seems to be cut off at the beginning of the New Testament. Christians believe in the old &amp; new testaments combined. Jewish people believe in the writings of the Torah (partially the old testament), and Muslims believe the teachings of the Quran (which largely resembles the Old Testament up to a point). You can speak as bitterly as you want to about every religion other than your own, but if you continue to spread a message that says that other religions are hateful and silly to follow, you will turn away more people from Christianity than you will convert.\\n\\nMy (probably unwelcome) suggestion is that you take a religion class that focuses on other monotheistic religions so that you may actually understand the positions of other religions instead of only following what you hear from other conservative Christians and focusing on how hateful and wrong other religions are. You can learn a lot from another religion and not have to practice it, which is a beautiful thing about theism.\"\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t normally post religious shit like this on facebook and I feel like an asshole for calling this guy out.

A few years ago I was staying with my cousins for the summer. They own a decent size ranch that I was helping them work on. One day they all went into town and I was there alone. I decided to try to do something productive so I went to go take out the trash and then go clean the barn. I went outside and got in the truck to head out. As I opened the door one of their dog\\'s jumped in the back as usual, no problem... Until I got to the barn, forgot the dog was in their and locked him in the blazing summer sun. I ended up dicking around playing on my phone and whatnot after finishing cleaning. About two hours had passed since I had left him in there. I opened the truck door to hear him panting and whimpering and immediately realized I fucked up. Me not having a drivers license or even knowing where a vet was drove as fast as I could to the house to get on the phone and call my cousins to tell them what was happening. No one picked up... I\\'m in a panic... Realizing he is burning I decide he needs water. I drive him back to the hose to pour cold water all over him and attempt to make him drink some. Then I see a truck. Thank God! One of my cousin\\'s is back. I run to tell him what happened. He comes over as fast as he can and at this point I think the dog has bitten his tongue because he is bleeding from the mouth. As we drive to the vet I tell my cousin that I had found him like this by the pond(to explain the wetness) We got him to the vet and they told us that his insides had burned up from the heat. We got a call back the next day for them to tell us he died. We then drive back to pick up the body. Surprisingly when we got there there was about a dozen dogs in the freezer that I can only assume had a similar unfortunate fate. Later that day I helped bury that dog in their woods. I think it\\'s been about two years and I still haven\\'t told them. At first it was out of fear and now I just feel like it\\'s a little too late to even mention it.

Me and Chris have been friends for 6years, I\\'m 19 right now. We originally met in school when we were 13-14 years old. Back then like most boys, we did nothing but play a lot of videogames. We weren\\'t your stereotypical Urkle-type nerd, but more the quiet bunch that played a lot of games and got along with nearly everyone. \\n\\nChris and me were part of a bigger group of \\'core\\' friends. But since Chris and me had been classmates we knew eachother very well. I considered him one of my best friends.\\n\\nBack then I was out of shape aswell, needless to say me and Chris were really good friends and not the most popular in the school. As a kid with low confidence going through puberty, I \\'dealt\\' with normal adolescent insecurities by being the nice guy. ( ~~sometimes to a fault when i look back at things~~ , definitely to a fault, I would let other people push me around )\\n\\n\\nDuring the next two years in school, I, then Chris respectivelly flunked a year in school. Because of this we ended up in different classes, and made different friends. I mostly hung out with my \\'core\\' group, Chris more and more with a new group of friends. We were 16 at the time, still very good friends but hanging out less because of different friend groups. Soon after Chris made his new friends, he became attractive and popular. ( And more dickisch in my opinion )\\n\\nChris would never have time to hang out with me or any other friends from the original \\'core\\' group anymore, since making new friends. This didn\\'t bother me too much, people made new friends all the time during adolescence. \\n\\nI only started getting annoyed with Chris not having the time to hang out with me, when 2-3times a month he would show up to my place after school to drop of his stuff, so he wouldn\\'t have to lugg it around when hanging out with his friends. I voiced once that I didn\\'t like it that he would use my house as his personal locker, but let myself get pushed over since i was too timid and friendly. This went on untill we were about 18. \\n\\n\\nWhen we bothe started uni, Chris said he would have more time to hang out with his old friends now, since he wouldn\\'t be able to see most of his then current friends. ( This always felt a bit fake to me, since it felt to me like our \\'core\\' group got labelled as a plan B, for when plan A wasn\\'t available )\\n\\nNow I\\'m a different person compared to when I was 13-16. I started lifting weights, grew till I was 1.88/6\"2, My \\'face\\' had become attractive aswell. I started kickboxing aswell. All these things grew me a lot of confidence.\\n\\nThe straw that tipped the bucket... So me and some friends of the old \\'core\\' group were hanging out at a quiet field with a nice view. Chris showed up aswell. ( Occasionally we\\'d meet when going out drinking/partying in town ). \\n\\n\\nWe sat in a cirkle and I was seated next to Chris. Chris started smoking and because of the direction of the wind, his smoke ended up in my face all the time. I stated this and asked him to either move, or stop smoking. He kinda ignored me and continued anyway. I sat in the grass for another 8ish seconds not really knowing how to make him stop since he wouldn\\'t listen to me. So i pushed him. (We were bothe sitting in the grass next to eachother, this was more a one-armed light shoulder push then a full rage sparta push). Chris just laughed this off, and continued smoking again, he said that the only reason he let the smoke get in my face was because i reacted to it. Even though I didn\\'t feel like I should have had to deal with this shit, I kept my mouth shut for another 15ish seconds whilst Chris continued to keep smoking. My other friends (and I guess Chris aswell) didn\\'t really notice how serious I was with being annoyed with having constant smoke in my face. Well, I bursted, I stood up, yelled at Chris, called him out for all his shit, took my bike and left while my other friends were trying to calm me down.\\n\\nI guess the reason I\\'m mad at Chris is because he never respected me once he became popular, He would use me as a friend for when he needed one. \\n\\nEven after I became known as the attractive guy in my auditorium, he still wouldn\\'t respect me. I always felt like he looked down on me as a friend. The worst part of this might be that I\\'m a confident guy, but I feel like a turn into a bitch whenever i stand across from Chris. Like I don\\'t really care what people think off me, or wheter they \\'respect\\' me or not. But for some reason I do with Chris, and I can\\'t get over it. I feel like an idiot just being able to get so mad and even typing a whole story like this over something that is so trivial in my life. \\n\\nSo... Am I the asshole for yelling at Chris (because I guess i\\'m insecure when it comes to him) or is Chris the Asshole.\\n \\nTLDR: used to be an quiet, friendly, low selfesteem type kid. Had a very good friend who turned popular, and I feel like he \\'used\\' and pushed me around as a friend, without ever standing up to him because of my low self esteem. We sort of parted ways naturally through school. By now I had become confident and popular myself. Was hanging out with some people including that particular \\'friend\\'. He blew smoke in my face and wouldn\\'t stop. I felt disrespected too much, and called him out on his shit.\\n\\n', 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'default', 'title': 'Am I the asshole for getting mad at my friend', 'url': 'http://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3bt28w/am_i_the_asshole_for_getting_mad_at_my_friend/'}, {'author': 'Cookie_Clicking_Gran', 'author_created_utc': 1383399144, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'author_fullname': 't2_dqtv7', 'created_utc': 1435794524, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3btbpb/aita_because_i_didnt_warn_my_sister/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '3btbpb', 'is_self': True, 'link_flair_css_class': 'not', 'link_flair_text': 'not the asshole', 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 2, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3btbpb/aita_because_i_didnt_warn_my_sister/', 'retrieved_on': 1440636756, 'score': 3, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': 'So I\\'ll cut to the chase, My twin sister is pretty irresponsible.

From the 26th till the 28th we were in Acadia National Park and we were all having a great time, my mom and I were doing really well at keeping things to ourselves when she frustrated us. She has a \"gluten intolerance\", self diagnosed, the doctor even told her to not worry about it.. She has body image issues so we understand her wanting to control her diet this way. She makes a big deal about it is the only problem, at one point she didn\\'t want to touch our bread and \"handle the gluten\", which I understand cause she was about to eat her own and could ingest it somehow, but I think that was a little extreme, if she had celiac I would understand on a logical level. \\n\\nThey are also moving to a bigger townhouse, she got a new job so she has some time off in between, and he works from home. (that\\'s a whole other story...) The movers were coming on Tuesday, the 30th, the day we left. The whole time we were there it was about 50-60% of what they were talking about. They over stress about everything, that\\'s not a secret they know its happening. \\n\\nOn our last day in Acadia we woke up at 3:30am to watch the sunrise on Cadillac mountain. My mom has Parkinson\\'s disease so staying on schedule is important, (this also makes traveling VERY difficult so it was a big deal that she was even feeling well enough to travel all the way there) when we got back to our cabin and tried to sleep she wasn\\'t able to so she was pretty slow all day. We drove around and saw some sights around the park, then went back to our respective cabins for lunch. My brother called me about an hour later and said, \"Do you two want to go to downtown bar harbor for a little bit? We were thinking about just walking around\" This was already the plan, and I\\'m paraphrasing but that was the gist of the conversation, that was all the information given. They come and pick us up, and once we are downtown and get out of the car my brother says, \"Ok we\\'re going to walk around for a little bit and de-stress, we\\'re just feeling anxious about the move.\" My mom, surprised that we weren\\'t going to be walking around with them, said \"oh, like separate and walk around?\" and he said, \"Yea, so just let us know if you need anything.\" and we all dispersed. \\n\\nWe were so surprised and hurt that we just didn\\'t know what to do, we couldn\\'t even enjoy ourselves, we found some souvenirs then sat and had some drinks. \\nWe met back at the car about 2 hours later with only seeing them briefly for maybe 2 minutes during that time. We got in the car and they had gotten us souvenirs, we said our thank you’s kind of awkwardly cause we were just still taken aback. We were driving to a restaurant that was really close, and while my mom was opening up what they got her she started crying, she couldn\\'t help it, she honestly tried to stop because we didn\\'t want to start anything. She just felt so cheated because instead of time with them we got stupid cheap presents. We flew from Texas to Maine to see THEM, not Maine, and made that very clear from the beginning. They needed to de-stress from a move that hadn\\'t happened yet and that they could have postponed so that it was not constantly on their minds when they were spending time with us. \\n\\nShe and my brothers apologized but it was the \"I\\'m sorry you felt that way\" apology, they didn\\'t actually understand what we were feeling. \\nNow that I’m typing all of this out I’m not sure how it will be taken, there is so much more that goes into this than just them not spending time with us. It’s the fact that they were so self absorbed the whole trip, so much so that they were interrupting my mom constantly with no apology, that we just felt so sad when they all sprang this on us. \\n\\nIf you read through all of that, thoughts and questions please!

I pointed out that women aren\\'t allowed to serve in my country\\'s army, and that I thought this was wrong - that if there is a fitness test for front line male soldiers, all the women would have to do is pass an equally tough result. IE both of them have to be able to run a mile in X minutes, where X = x, and X is minutes for men, x is minutes for women. However this point didn\\'t matter, because my friend who had made the post about women not being allowed into dangerous jobs apparently doesn\\'t care about dangerous jobs, despite literally just mentioning it. My sister also called me out on my false \"moving the goal posts\" statement - something that I did not mention. I did not mention any requirements changing, I know for a fact women in my country cannot serve dedicated front line jobs (we have things like front line medics, but they\\'re not designed to be the actual front line), and my knowledge on the fact that men and women have differing fitness requirements for non-front line jobs comes from my agender sister\\'s own military fitness book that we used to exercise from.\\n\\nAt this point, my sibling claimed that she was \"disappointed\" in me, saying that my views were very \"Daily Mail inspired\" and \"MRA-esque\". Despite the fact that they know  the only thing I read from the Daily Mail is Garfield, and that my \"MRA\"-ness goes as far as old school feminism where I want equal for both genders. Sometimes, as a man, I\\'ll talk about where society fails us, like education.\\n\\nAt this point she continued to insult me and then said that she was too tired to continue to \"educate\" me, asking the other two girls to do the job. Apparently no amount of \"back-peddling\" or \"I\\'m on your side\" would help.\\n\\nIn this entire debacle, only two people used sources, my sibling and myself. I was accused of only doing \"15 minutes\" of research, despite spending over an hour on a single government piece solely about this subject. This was in a post in which I received several articles mostly picked just for their headlines.

After years of planning and saving and life events (college, marriage, divorce) I finally have time and money to go visit my family. My sister hears about this and decides she's coming along. I say okay, that's fine, and she can bring her kids, since her husband will be busy working. She has no money, so she calls and has my dad send her money for her plane tickets. I put the tickets on my card so we can get all the tickets at the same time. This was last year.\\n\\nFast forward to this year, she is going through a separation now, and says she doesn't have access to her money now so she still hasn't paid me back. In the meantime, now she's got a new boyfriend, who she emailed the flight details to, so he could come along. He, if course forgot to get a ticket for the second leg of either flight there or back, so it was up to me again to buy his connecting flight tickets.\\n\\nWe finally get there, and get settled and sleeping. She lets me sleep late, making me miss breakfast with the family, followed by having the family take her and the kids out. This turned into her hanging around her boyfriend while I watched the kids.\\n\\nNow it's the next day and she also wrangled the family into taking her to Disney. Now we're there, and its basically get walking ahead with her boyfriend while I'm in back carrying and walking with her kids and our father, who is old, so he's slow.\\n\\nNow I'm sitting outside of a ride with the kids and my father, since someone has to watch the kids, so I wont be able to go on any rides while I'm here I'm guessing. The wait time for the ride is an hour.\\n\\nAm I the asshole fir sitting here getting more and more annoyed at her for basically turning my vacation to visit my family into her romantic getaway with her new boyfriend? \\n\\nTL;DR:\\n\\nI've been saving up to go visit my extended family I haven't seen for years. My sister finds out and over a few changes turned it into her all-expenses paid romantic getaway where I'm basically her attache.\\n\\nMy defense: It was my trip, but I ended up paying for 5.5 tickets (me, her, two kids, one flight for the boyfriend) because the money she got the family to give her for tickets is going toward a divorce, and missing all family meals. Now I'm at Disney watching the kids while she and the boy go on rides.\\n\\nHer defense: it's her family too, and she says the recent soon to be ex husband has her finances tied up, and she has no job, and a new apartment.\", 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'default', 'title': 'AITA for being annoyed at my sister for turning my family visit trip into her romantic getaway?', 'url': 'http://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3bvzwt/aita_for_being_annoyed_at_my_sister_for_turning/'}, {'author': 'Andremeria', 'author_created_utc': 1392650830, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'author_fullname': 't2_fbebb', 'created_utc': 1435857523, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3bw5dx/aita_for_1ply_toilet_paper/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '3bw5dx', 'is_self': True, 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 3, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3bw5dx/aita_for_1ply_toilet_paper/', 'retrieved_on': 1440635438, 'score': 2, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': '', 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'default', 'title': 'AITA for 1-Ply Toilet Paper?', 'url': 'http://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3bw5dx/aita_for_1ply_toilet_paper/'}, {'author': 'itsmeJD', 'author_created_utc': 1360180369, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'author_fullname': 't2_ai1pk', 'created_utc': 1435870142, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'edited': 1435888635, 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3bwxm1/am_i_the_asshole_for_using_the_fridge_at_work_the/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '3bwxm1', 'is_self': True, 'link_flair_css_class': 'not', 'link_flair_text': 'not the asshole', 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 7, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3bwxm1/am_i_the_asshole_for_using_the_fridge_at_work_the/', 'retrieved_on': 1440635072, 'score': 8, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': \"Ok, this is really petty, but *someone* still has to be wrong, right?\\n\\nI work in an office of 4 people.  Two employees, one boss, and the boss' lackey.  There is a big, family sized fridge in the kitchen area that is--at most--1/3 full with everyone's stuff.  Some of us like the same things, like single serve (12 oz) bottles of diet coke, but nobody labels their stuff or steals because we all know what we brought in, and if we can't tell the difference between one bottle or another, we don't take more than we brought, and everything evens out.  \\n\\nSo today, I open one of two absolutely full bottles of diet coke, and don't think I heard much of a fizz but didn't think much of it and had a sip.

But I start asking people what's up because I want to notify whoever's drink I wasted, and was curious why they opened a bottle, drank absolutely nothing, and left it in the fridge.  \\n\\nTurns out the boss drank half of one a month ago and then told his lackey to put it back on the fridge.  Lackey does this, and some days later, the boss started another bottle, and told him to refrigerate the half that's left.  The lackey poured them both in the same bottle and left it there with no label *to save space*.  And it sat for weeks before I got to it.  Now, the lackey is pissed at me for throwing away the boss' drink.   I'm pissed at him for leaving a mixture of two different days of backwash looking like a brand new drink in a community fridge, and I'm not willing to replace it because it was garbage before I opened it, and there's no reason to be combining half drunk bottles and risking confusion.

On our way over a coworker, we\\'ll call her Bethany, got my girlfriend\\'s attention and asked about trivial stuff while I paced ahead of them, not wanting to get involved.  When my GF told me to slow down because I was walking too fast, I told her (loud enough that she could hear me, about 20 feet away) that she was talking to Bethany and I \"didn\\'t want to have anything to do with that.\"  My girlfriend knows the past stuff that has gone on between Bethany and I, and knows that I do not like this person.\\n\\nAnyway, I went into the convenience store and Bethany followed us in.  I think she came up to me first, came behind me while I was at the counter, and said, \"That was highly inappropriate,\"  I said back, \"Well I\\'m not going to be rude to you at work, but outside of work...\"  I believe it was then that she came up to my girlfriend and said that, \"You better tell your girl that if I ever hear my name pass her lips again, I\\'m going to fucking kill her.\"\\n\\nNow, my GF and I sat down for a little while, eating our breakfast sandwiches that we bought, and she told me that, \"Sometimes the things I say are so embarassing.\"  This is when she told me that Bethany had threatened my life.\\n\\nLet me give you a little back story, so you know the context.\\n\\nI\\'ve been working here for about a year, and the first cubicle I was assigned to I sat immediately behind Bethany.  I knew who she was because I had seen her on the bus before (gotta love mass transit, right?) and I tried to become friends with her, since that\\'s always my reaction to meeting new people.  She would have good days and bad days, and to be honest, my humor tends towards dry sarcasm.  Everyone else that I interract with at work gets the same, but only she seems to take it personally.  The incident that prompted her first threat against me was very mild, I thought.\\n\\nWe have a rule at work that cell phones are not to be out and used.  If a supervisor sees you with a cell phone then they will pass that along to your supervisor and then they will possibly take disciplinary action against you.  On this particular day, I had gotten up to use the bathroom and on my way back she startled hard, because she was on her phone and scared that it might be a Sup and not a coworker who had seen her breaking the rules. I appologized for startling her, and sat down and went back to work.  The next time it happened again.  This time, as I passed her and she freaked out, I said that maybe if she didn\\'t have her cell phone out, she wouldn\\'t be so startled by people walking past her.  When I sat down she said, very quietly, that she would beat me up after work.\\n\\nShe didn\\'t.  But ever since that day I have actively tried to avoid being in the same place at the same time.  Obviously sometimes, like this morning, it is unavoidable.\\n\\nI brought this to the attention of my union, but the entire thing still makes me think that I may have somehow overreacted when I said, within earshot of Bethany, that I didn\\'t want to have anything to do with her.  Should I have been more meek about this?\\n\\nTL;DR: Coworker that has a history of threatening me took it to the max this morning when she told my girlfriend (who was with me) that she would \"fucking kill me\".

I leave my fate to you, Reddit. \\n\\nAlright, so it's a little more complicated than the title makes it sound. I was good friends with a group of people. One of which was my best friend, and although I loved hanging out with him, I know I was often an asshole to him. I have no idea why- he was nothing but nice to me and I tried really hard not to be. \\n\\nAnyway, friend gets a girlfriend. She's over a lot and pretty cool, but their relationship is... Strange. For reasons unknown, friend wanted to be in an open relationship. I have to admit, this is something I never saw him take advantage of. His girlfriend was extremely upset by this, but still went along with it. A little while into it and she starts to flirt with me. At the time, I was an incorrigible flirt but I would still try to curb my words around her. Eventually, one night at a party, we had sex. I don't remember if she'd been drinking or not,  but I sure as hell had. I gave faint memories coming in and out of it. \\n\\nWell, the relationship continued from there. For a while she'd talked about being worried that friend didn't love her at all and just went through the motions. Well, we hooked up a few more times as a bit of an open secret. I wasn't discreet about it- I didn't see any reason to be- but I wasn't coming home telling stories either. I knew friend knew, but I assumed it was just part of the agreement. After all, isn't that what an open relationship is? I wasn't going to openly try and disrespect him (a word I remember using several times that first night in my semiconcious state) but.. I mean... There were no rules against it. \\n\\nLater he's dating another girl. She's wonderful as well. Says a few strange things to me. We click pretty well and have a few strange chats. Honestly, I mostly appreciated her writings. They went through the same thing but this time with me trying to stay out of it. When the time came that they broke up, she messaged me some things and treated me as a 3rd party that knew both sides but was neutral. I offered to take her to dinner (not that romantic. I ate free at a nearby restaurant and frequently took people). I got a phone call on my way over from another neutral friend, furious at me. I backed off to let them sort out their own problems. \\n\\nRoommate saw it as me swooping in, which was a valid but ultimately false concern. Her and I texted some... Uh... Things while they were on brake. But again, it was an open relationship, she had told me it felt like he didn't even like talking to her, I kinda talked like that with everyone, and I hadn't been confronted or even implicated in the first breakup. \\n\\nLater I learned that he was furious during the whole thing but didn't tell me. Also, both relationships were given a single rule I wasn't aware of- no relationships with me. I was told by the first one that she even had conversations about this and he seemed to not care. \\n\\nI know I'm on the asshole scale, and I'm above 'not an asshole'. I should have considered the feelings of my friend but, honestly, I thought he had none on the subject. Both girls expressed to me how angry they were on the subject, so I'm not sure how much I could have know. I thought it would be rude to talk about (in the same way it would be rude to being up you beating someone's high-score in an arcade game), but I'm not much of a talker anyway. \\n\\nSo give it to me.

That\\'s why this will probably sound stupid.\\n\\nLast year I dated this girl, let\\'s call her Allie. Allie was..well..kind of a nymphomaniac. She\\'d been with more guys than she could remember, and she\\'s done basically everything. If you think I\\'m exaggerating..I won\\'t go into graphic detail, but it\\'s more than any of you are thinking.\\n\\nIn contrast, I had yet to go beyond kissing a girl, and was, honestly, super excited. However, we both had big issues with depression, and so I ended up breaking up with her after about two months. The reason for this is that she was incredibly attached to me, and she was becoming unhealthily obsessed. I knew she\\'d never be truly happy if she depended on me as a crutch, so I tried to stand by her as a friend, telling her that maybe once we\\'d figured ourselves out we could try again.\\n\\nLater that year, she disappeared. Signed out of every class, just...gone. It honestly messed me up really badly. I was 90% sure that she\\'d killed herself. No social media updates, no indicators at all. I moved on with life, and had a couple other casual relationships, but they always felt kind of empty. All the time apart made me realize how badly I actually needed her as much as she\\'d needed me.\\n\\nFlash forward to about a month ago, and I see that she\\'s updated Facebook again. I messaged her immediately, and we made plans to hang out. Turns out she\\'d gone to a mental health facility for teens, and she would be moving back within a month. We meet up, at the topic of dating gets brought up. She says that when she moves back (she was visiting home) in around a month, then we can try again. However, she says *once she\\'s settled back in* we\\'ll try again. Now, I was fine with this, because of course she\\'ll need readjusting time. \\n\\nShe moved back almost 20 days ago, which is to my mind, adequate settling in time. No worries though, I totally respect that she has some things left to sort through. The difficult part is finding out what she\\'s been doing during that time- the answer being multiple other guys. I guess she thinks since we aren\\'t dating again yet, there\\'s no commitment, and I suppose that\\'s true. However, She knows that we might get back together soon, and is still just fucking everyone who asks. (Her reputation gets around.) I held out on \"serious\" (high school) relationships waiting for her to get back, and I feel kind of violated knowing that she\\'s banging everyone in sight. I feel kind of betrayed, and I want to break things off, but multiple people have said that since we aren\\'t officially dating yet, it shouldn\\'t bother me.\\n\\nSo reddit, am i the asshole?', 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA For not waiting on a girl?', 'url': 'http://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3c35mb/aita_for_not_waiting_on_a_girl/'}, {'author': 'flignir', 'author_created_utc': 1337108497, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': 'Asshole #1', 'author_fullname': 't2_7q73v', 'created_utc': 1436048883, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3c58ah/am_i_the_asshole_for_not_making_my_sub_private/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '3c58ah', 'is_self': True, 'link_flair_css_class': 'not', 'link_flair_text': 'not the asshole', 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 10, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3c58ah/am_i_the_asshole_for_not_making_my_sub_private/', 'retrieved_on': 1440631141, 'score': 24, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': \"Now that I've read more about it, I still think we shouldn't have gone private. Basically, as moderators of a sub, if we do that in protest, it would imply to readers that we have some inside knowledge or expert perspective that makes us an authority on this subject, and I have no such knowledge. Ours is a small sub; so small that I have never expected any direct access to site admins or corporate leaders, so I don't know what the people at AskReddit may know about how they fail to do this. Also, I don't understand the tools we have as sub mods well enough to complain about their inadequacy. (I can't even get our logo to show up where it belongs!)\\n\\nThe one gripe I do understand is the requirement that reddit sets global (and sometimes poorly explained) reddiquette and demands all subs force their commenters to comply, even when it conflicts with the sub's purpose. That's already been a thorn in our side, but I really don't resent corporate leadership's position on this. Sure, the rules could be written more clearly, but in today's oversensitive culture and litigious climate, corporations have to put some pretty stringent shackles on people's actions on their forum or in their name just to avoid being publicly scapegoated into exile, sued out of existence, or criminally prosecuted. That's the nature of being a large operating entity.\\n\\nAnd sure, from my perspective, the sudden firing and failure to immediately transition /u/chooter/'s position seems awkward and arbitrary, but I literally don't know the first thing about what went on.  I've known of no statement made about why she was fired, or why the speed of transition needed to be rushed.\\nSo as a subreddit mod, I think making such an official move to protest ought be done with more consideration than the average Facebooker sharing a Kony video or putting a rainbow filter on his profile pic because everyone else is doing it.

The pedestrian walkway starts in a residential area and all parking spots around the residential area are for cars with permit only.

Well, fast forward a couple years after I didn't have that 3 way because I ended up getting black out drunk at the college she went to and forgot about them, and she's engaged to my childhood friend, and she's pregnant. Now I'm a pretty liberal guy, and very open minded. She's very conservative. We're friends on Facebook and she posts shit saying Obama should be impeached and things like that, and I always like the cnn article of 182 things obama has done, and each one has citation. But then today she posted a picture saying something along the lines of marriage isn't about religion, or finances, and it's only about love. Then I posted something along the lines of saying it's wrong of her to sit there and say someone getting married because it's part of their religion, or making it a financial decision is wrong when she expects others to be tolerant of her views on it. She then proceeded to threaten me, and attack me personally. Which I ignored the personal attacks, and the threat because of my respect for my old friend. Then before I respond she tags him in it, and he calls me a douche for calling her on her shit. I responded by saying that I was happy for them (I'm not, she's a bitch and a slut) but that if she expects others to be open to her ideas about marriage she has to be open to others. She then threatened me again, and attacked me saying that my father didn't want me and I'm a failure. I don't talk to my dad by choice, and while I recently quit my job I have no debt, an she has student loans for a degree she didn't finish, and no job. I didn't say any of that though, nor did I post any of the pictures of her I have, nor did I tell him about the tumblr page she used to have that I got those pictures off of. What I did tell her is to thank him that I'm not going to flip out on her, and I blocked her. Then I messaged him saying I'm sorry things had to go down like that, and blocked him.\\n\\nPS I haven't talked to my dad in over a year and haven't seen him in about 2 and a half.

Public pool, HUGE playground and jungle gym, soccer field, and a full covered, regulation sized basketball court. \"Wanna warm up with a game of horse?\" I ask. He agrees, and we start shooting, running, and rebounding. We keep it half court, because a 50-something father and his teenage children had started a two-on-two game of their own on the other side.\\n\\nBy the time my bf accumulates an H, O, and R (I had less; ball is life), a tall 30-something father walks into the court area, straight towards our basket with his two sons. The older son could not have been more than FIVE years old. His younger brother, still all bald-headed with his natal-headed self, could not have been more than TWO years old.

We didn\\'t mean to interrupt anything!\" The bf and I are not combative people, so after less than 10 minutes of total game play, he and I leave the park and walk back home.\\n\\nOne the walk back home he and I furiously threw out sentences to pinpoint why we felt so shitty about what just happened. \"In any neighborhood basketball court ANYwhere, dibs are dibs.\" \"Agism?

This post is specifically about two friends (Ryan and Mike) who are keeping something from me that I completely know about.\\nI used to hangout with another friend (Ash), but I don't keep in contact with him now. He's the kind of person who will be friendly around you, but will never want to talk to you or invite you to things  if he doesn't need to/loses interest. He used to invite me to all his small events, but nowadays he is throwing parties constantly, and Ryan and Mike are constantly going.

So on top of the fact that I don't get invited, I also have to tap through a photo collection featuring Ryan and Mike partying with Ash.\\nThe thing is, Ryan and Mike won't admit they're doing anything with Ash. I asked them what they did the day after the party, and they just say they did nothing. They're intentionally hiding the fact that they're going, and especially the fact that I don't get invited to their events. This hurts, because I asked Ryan if Ash does anything anymore, and he says that Ash hasn't been doing anything recently. They won't admit anything's happening, \\n\\nSo this is where the AITA comes in:\\nLately I've been hosting movie nights, because Ryan once mentioned that he'd like to start them.

My brothers have wives and kids, so they don't have the same amount of expendable cash. \\n\\nI'm currently talking with a coworker about going to a sporting event within the next few weeks, but I hesitate to invite my brothers. I invited my dad since I owe my parents so much, so I don't mind paying for a ticket for him, but I know if I ask my brothers, one of three things will happen. First and simplest is that they won't want to go (highly unlikely). Second is that they'll say yes, but not  be able to afford it at which point I'll feel bad and end up paying for tickets for all of us (myself, my dad, and my brothers). Third and more likely is that they'll want to go, can't afford the more expensive tickets I want to get and will talk me into getting cheap nose bleed tickets. We almost always go this route and it would be nice to actually be able to see the fights without looking at a screen.

To add to this, and this may sound petty, I was pretty let down on my birthday by the fact that I received very little from my brothers. One brother, in fact, gave me nothing. I know I shouldn't expect anything in return, but I do go out of my way to get them, and their families, as much as I can for the holidays and their birthdays, but I never see anywhere near the same amount from them. Last year, I spent close to a thousand dollars on their families for Christmas and was given less than $100 in gifts. I love giving, but after a while it feels completely one sided. It doesn't help that I feel the adults exchanging gifts is silly and the gift giving should be limited to the children, mostly because of this very reason. Even if things were completely even, we are essentially exchanging same valued gift cards which doesn't make sense.\\n\\nAm I the asshole for being selfish and wanting to have good seats without having to shell out hundreds of dollars for everyone for a change? \\n\\nPS: Found this sub today while reading a random thread on another forum.

That'll take you your whole life.\\n\\n\\nMe: nah learning a new language comes naturally and easy for me\\n\\n\\nHim: HAHHAHAHA now that's a funny joke\\n\\n\\nMe: hey! I took four years of Spanish and personally tutored a girl with her Spanish homework in the 11th grade!\\n\\n\\nHim: Yeah and how much of that do you remember?\\n\\n\\nMe: a decent amount of it\\n\\n\\nHim: yeah decent that's not a lot. If you were natural then you'd remember everything and you can speak completely fluent.\\n\\n\\nMe: I didn't take it to learn it fluently. I just found that it came easy for me to learn\\n\\n\\nHim: well then its easy for you to learn then but you're not a natural at it at all.\\n\\n\\nMe: being a natural as in something that comes naturally. basically a talent. me having the talent to learn a new language quickly and being able to use it\\n\\n\\nHim: Dude.. yes you're really good at learning the language BUT that does not mean you're a natural at it.. If you're a natural at it then you should be able retain your knowledge of the language, being fluent, AND learning it quickly. But you can only learn it quickly so you're just good at learning it..\\n\\n\\nMe: I can still make a paragraph like this: Me llamo Luke. Yo hablo Ingles. Yo tengo veinte y dos anos. Me favorito el color es rojo y me favorito comida es pizza. me cumpleanos es siete de marzo. which translates to My name is Luke. I speak English. I am 22 years old. My favorite color is red and my favorite food is pizza. My birthday is on March 7th.\\n\\n\\nMe: gosh it's been seven years since I used any spanish\\n\\n\\nHim: I copied it to my friend and he said this is about the level of a second year student at best and he said that you had some mistakes in there. So this doesn't really make you a natural for just one paragraph and you're not speaking fluently. if you can speak fluently you should be able to write and speak A LOT more than just one paragraph.\\n\\n\\nMe: that's just a really simple example. that's barely first year Spanish. and of course it will have a few mistakes after not using Spanish for years. here's something more advanced: Podemos salir la semana que viene? Quiero ver mas Merlin con usted. Me encanta que muestran tanto. Which means Can we hang out next week? I want to watch more Merlin with you. I love that show so much.\\n\\n\\nHim: Yeah but if you're a natural at it and you took it for four years you would FOR SURE remember everything and wont make any mistakes AND you can understand EVERYTHING. So basically you will be able to FULLLY and fluently speak to someone from Mexico. So you are not really a natural....\\n\\n\\nMe: I took two years In middle school and two years in high school. those classes don't teach you to speak fluently like someone from mexico. I can't remember everything after seven years of not using Spanish. It fades overtime. If I dove right back into it now and studied for a few weeks, I'd be a natural at it again. what I'm saying is that I have natural talent to learn a new language when I study it\\n\\n\\nHim: omg.... fine you seriously think you're a fucking natural then go fucking learn Japanese or Chinese or Korean and see how fast you can learn and see if you can remember all of it. If you can do that then I'll believe you're a natural. But as of right now I do not...\\n\\n\\nMe: gosh, I'm just trying to have a discussion about my experience with learning a language and explaining how I am when it comes to learning new things. I actually want to learn some Japanese. can you help me with that at all?\\n\\n\\nHim: Well you clearly don't know what it means to be a natural... That's why I'm pissed because you saying that you are but you really are not... Yes you're good at learning it but you are not a natural at it...\\n\\n\\nMe: I perfectly know what being a natural is. It means having a gift or talent for a specific activity, allowing one to learn something quickly without A LOT of practice or hard work and being able to demonstrate that. In my case, when I took Spanish, I was able to learn quickly without the need to study a lot and was able to demonstrate my ability through written work and through speaking to others. I am not a natural at speaking the language now, but a natural at picking up a language quickly and developing skill at a face paced rate. As for you, you're a natural at  hand-to-hand combat. You taught yourself how to fight and you're really good at it.\\n\\n\\nHim: You know what... Im fucking done talking to you tonight.... Im not gonna even read all of this shit.... You always just fucking argue and argue that's all you do.... Im sick of this shit.......\\n\\n\\nMe: All I was doing was discussing and explaining my experiences with learning something and showing you examples of what I learned, then you just had to argue about one little thing and swear at me and get mad. You can't say that I am not a natural at something, because I know myself best from personal experience.

I start off by saying ill clean it yea but im telling you i did it this morning, the toothpaste ju-and she cuts me off midsentence raising her voice. This really pissed me off because thats such a blatant sign of disrespect. Like at least let me finish what i was saying(the stains left by toothpaste for whatever reason must not have come off with water). So i raised my voice calling her out for disrespecting what I was saying and she cuts me off again so i ended up screaming at her. Listen, i know i shouldnt have let it escalate to that point, however after the day weve had i felt even more disrespected because of how respectful she had been earlier talking with me.

But if you want more details I can provide. I'm 21 (just graduated college) and my brother is 17. \\n\\nMy mom and I were estranged for about 8 years until very recently. The reason for this reconnection was that my grandma (mom's mom) was going through a lot of health issues and with death as a possible outcome, wished for everyone to set aside their grudges and get along. I do so to honor my beloved grandma and start talking to my mom again. \\n\\nA few months pass after we reconcile and we suddenly find out that my mom has stage 4 colon cancer. That same day she is going in for surgery and I book flight tickets to Texas for me and my little brother (who is fondest of her) ASAP. Some cousins and uncles also drive out there to see her. \\n\\nWhen me and my brother go see her she's happy and annoyed that we came to see her. Understandable, as it was expensive to rent a car and fly out next day. I let it pass because I know how cheap and selfless she can be. Whatever. But then she continues to lecture us about our life choices, like why I didn't become a doctor or nurse, that I should dump my boyfriend because he's into music, that my brother needs a haircut etc. I kind of let these comments pass. As in I don't snap at her like I usually do and just tell her that these are the decisions we made and are happy with it. These comments continue for the next five days while me and my brother are sleeping in the same hospital room as her sharing a cot. By the end of it I was glad to leave for my planned vacation, but I still replied to these comments civilly as I sadly realize she's lecturing us while she still can. And of course, she is polite and friendly to the cousins and uncles who showed up for one day. \\n\\nMy little brother stays behind as the whole family thought it would be best for someone to stay with my mom for support. I was leaving for a planned trip, but was going to come back to Texas afterwards (~1.5 weeks). The cousins and uncles have work so they could not. \\n\\nWithin a few days, I get a call from my mom complaining about my brother's behavior. I talk to him, and realize she was just exaggerating and causing a fuss. A day or so later I get texts from my brother complaining about how my mom is being really bitchy. Saying things like how her kids don't really love her and that she loves the cousins more than us, her kids. Then I get a text from her saying how I need to fly my brother out of there because he's bothering her and making her cancer spread faster. \\n\\nThat was the last straw. I texted her a reply defending my brother basically. And that if she didn't stop being a bitch she'd alienate all her children (my older sister doesn't talk to her much either). I haven't heard from her since. Or any news from my brother. \\n\\nI'm supposed to be driving back in a few days but things got complicated again as my boyfriends cousin just died and we have to make it back in time for the funeral. My brother thinks I should just stay where I am, but I want to come out to support him (I think it's unhealthy for him mentally to deal with her alone) and the rest of my family is expecting me to drive out there because I already said I would. But I also don't want to go because I'm sick of dealing with this shit. \\n\\nNow I don't know if I'm an ass for not wanting to deal with my mother with cancer.

I\\'ll put a TL;DR at the end.\\n\\nSome context: I\\'m a 20 year old single male in Ontario.\\n\\nSo, I recently changed up my Tinder profile. Two or three days ago, I matched with this girl whose profile said that she\\'s 19 and that she was only a few kilometers away from me. We started talking a lot, but only about silly superficial stuff like how our summers are going, TV shows, etc...\\n\\nShe is mad cute (I swear I\\'m not saying this as a humble-brag haha. She looks like a younger Eliza Coupe, but with red hair and imo slightly prettier). Despite that, I didn\\'t ask her on a date because she seemed a little immature. However, this morning, she messaged me saying that she had her apartment to herself and asked if I wanted to come over. So obviously I accepted and bussed over.\\n\\nSo I get to her building, I ask to meet outside (because safety first!), we both verify that the other person is indeed real and not a scary old man, and then we go inside and start making out.\\n\\nJust to reiterate, we basically knew nothing about each other because we kept our messages the past few days very casual. Anyways, before we progress past making out, she tells me that she\\'s a virgin. To be honest, I didn\\'t really believe her at that point (because she invited me over despite never having met before, and it was hard to believe that it was the first time she did something like that). However, I\\'m now pretty sure that she was telling the truth because there was a bit of blood when we first started and it also unfortunately seemed to hurt her a little bit. Anyways, so she asked me to be gentle and she said she was nervous, so we talked a bit before we actually had sex and I told her that we didn\\'t have to do anything she wasn\\'t comfortable with and that she shouldn\\'t feel pressured or rushed, especially with a guy she just met. But she said she was down, and so we did the deed.\\n\\nSo afterwards, we laid in her bed chatting. After a bit, we got dressed and I asked her if she would mind giving me a ride back to my place (I bussed over). She said that she couldn\\'t because she only had her learner\\'s permit (and in Ontario, that means that you can\\'t drive without having an experienced driver in the front seat). So I jokingly asked her why she took so long to get her license (her Tinder profile said she\\'s 19) and she told me that she actually turned 16 a few weeks ago.\\n\\nI was literally in shock. I was so mad because I was under the impression that she was 19, and I just found out that I had sex with a 16-year old. In her defense, she never explicitly *told* me that she\\'s 19 or lied about her age, but I assumed that her Tinder profile was accurate. Also, at this point, I legitimately thought that I just unknowingly did something illegal by having sex with a minor (thankfully I Googled it later and it turns out the age of consent in Canada is 16 so I\\'m safe, but still! If it was even a month or two ago, I could be in some deep legal trouble just because she lied on her profile.)\\n\\nIn retrospect, I\\'m not proud of this, but I flipped the fuck out and got so mad, especially because I was really worried that I did something that could get me in a lot of trouble. She started crying and she told me that she didn\\'t think the age discrepancy was a big deal, but I couldn\\'t bring myself to apologize because I was fuming so I just left and bussed back home. (Side note: I didn\\'t say anything deliberately hurtful, call her any names, or say anything even remotely like a personal attack. It was more so a rant about how I couldn\\'t believe she thought not telling me about her age was OK.)\\n\\nAfter I cooled off a bit, I messaged her saying that I was sorry for being angry but she hasn\\'t responded yet.\\n\\nAt the time, I felt that I was completely justified in my anger. However, now that I think about it, I\\'m worried that I may have been an asshole. From her perspective, it must have sucked to have a guy she just had sex with flip out on her. Especially since it was her first time ever, and she may very well have been in a vulnerable place emotionally. To make matters even worse, at the risk of sounding patronizing, we all made stupid choices at the age of 16 and I maybe could have been more understanding. I really do feel bad now, but aside from sending her another apology message I don\\'t know what to do. And, to be fair, I still think that I had every right to be upset - I probably should have just handled it better.\\n\\nI told a few friends before I went to her place that I was meeting with a girl from Tinder, but I haven\\'t told anyone yet about us having sex, about her being 16, or about my angry reaction. That\\'s why I\\'m here - I want some impartial and honest opinions about whether or not I am an asshole, and in addition, what I should have done instead. Thanks in advance.\\n\\nTL;DR: Had sex with a Tinder match who was a virgin and whose profile said she was 19, turned out she\\'s only 16, got really angry.

I would mostly live with my mother and step dad, and would visit my father and step mom every other weekend. My dad is the kind of person that the good times are great, and the bad times are horrible. I remember him yelling and hitting me when I would visit sometimes, but there were also great times where I bonded with my dad. Around my junior year in HS I started to get really sick of going up to visit him. I would have to use MY gas money now to drive two hours upstate to be away from my friends and to be in a house with a crazy family. To my dads credit, he would always drive round trip 4 hours to pick me up every weekend up until I could drive. At this point he had the same wife, who always seemed so fake to me, a daughter(my half sister who I liked) and an terrible son(cursing hitting screaming at his mom at 5 years old) who, from what I assume came from my fathers actions toward him that I had experience in a small dose. Another thing I should point out is that since I was the oldest sibling in my dad and step moms family, they weren\\'t very experience with parenting a 17 year old. They treated me like I was a little kid still. This one instance sticks out to me: we were at an Applebee\\'s and a big UFC fight was on(I can\\'t remember which one) but I asked the waitress to change the channel to put it on. She came back and said that the manger wouldn\\'t allow it because of how violent it was. I guess my dad and step mom didn\\'t realize what I was asking to put on the TV before, but they starting apologizing for me ASKING to put on MMA. In a bar. Where there was boxing on the other TV to the left. \"Oh we\\'re so sorry, we didn\\'t realize that he wanted THAT on.\" Like I was just a stupid little kid. Anyways, the rest of my dads family I LOVED, and still do. My cousin was one of my best friends but I haven\\'t spoken to him for about a year(I\\'ll get to that in a little bit)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn my junior year of HS I played baseball for the varsity team so I pretty much stopped visiting during baseball season, but he understood. In the summer between my junior and senior year, he gave me his car as my birthday present (2006 Chrysler 300). In the fall of my senior year, It was my responsibility to drive 2 hours to his house to visit every other weekend. But I didn\\'t want to put up with him being an asshole, or his douchebag son and fake wife so I made up excuses as to why I couldn\\'t visit. I probably visited one weekend a month during that fall.  Fast forward to about two weeks before Christmas, he texts me and asks me when I was going to visit(my parents always split Christmas and Christmas Eve). I told him that id go up 3 days before Christmas Eve and leave Christmas Day to go to my moms house. He was NOT happy with this. He wanted me to spend my whole 2 week vacation before Christmas with him and come back to my moms on Christmas Day. I told him no way and went up 3 days before Christmas Eve. So we were already fighting, and every visit to his house sucked. Fast forward to Christmas Eve- my dads whole family is over for dinner, and we hadn\\'t been talking for the 3 days before at all. I am trying to make my plate of food,  and here he comes telling me how to make my plate of food. Thanks dad, I\\'m SEVENTEEN FUCKING YEARS OLD I KNOW HOW TO MAKE MY PLATE OF FOOD BY NOW. I tell him to \"get out of my face\". Well he doesn\\'t like this very much and in front of his whole family says he wanted me out of his life. Well that night I made my decision and gave him what he wanted. When I left the next morning to go back to my moms house, that was the last time I\\'ve seen him. I blocked his phone number. Over the past 6 months he has been getting his son and daughter to call me and lea messages saying \"we miss you come back\" etc etc. he got my aunt to text me but I ignored her text. Not because I don\\'t love her, but because replying to her would surely lead to having to see him again. Am I an asshole for cutting off a whole family?

When not at university we live about 2 hours drive apart. Although we are both still young and the relationship is still in its relatively early stages we are both crazy about each other and seem to have spent almost all of our time together, up to the point where we were living together (with other housemates) at university for the past 2 years.\\n\\nSo basically, over our first summer apart she went abroad to work at a kid\\'s camp for 12 weeks (which she had planned doing before we met). She had a great time but the problem was I didn\\'t have anything to occupy myself with to sufficiently fill the time that would have been spent with her, although we did get to chat via text/Skype occasionally. So naturally, for the time she was away, I became a bit bored and sometimes lonely. As sometimes over the 9-12 week period it felt like we weren\\'t together; but overall I felt that as long as she was happy and our relationship was still healthy then I was happy.\\n\\nFast forward 12 months and she decided to go away again, for various reasons, this time for 9 weeks. Me, not wanting to deny her the opportunity and not wanting to be a dick, hadn\\'t really mentioned to her about how I felt and coped with minimal contact with her.  So off she went without realising that I secretly, perhaps selfishly, didn\\'t want her to go. While she was a way I put on a brave face and pretended like everything was fine and only after she got back did I let it out how I felt. Admittedly I was a bit irrational and got a bit offensive at some points when we tried to talk it out but we managed to sort it out and she appreciated how I felt and we came to some sort of conclusion. In fact, through no input or persuasion of mine, she had decided she wasn\\'t going to return to camp for a third time. And our relationship went back to normal and we seemed to be getting along perfectly.\\n\\nUntil earlier this year when she received an invitation to go back to camp again, this time with a promotion. Originally she declined the offer as she felt she couldn\\'t go again and didn\\'t want to put any further strain on our relationship. However, due to circumstances at home (she basically no longer had a room at her parents\\' house as they were going to rent it out, and she didn\\'t have a place at uni any more) she told me she was thinking about going. Naturally, I wanted her to stay. So I offered for her to stay with me and even consulted my parents about it. However, she seemed to had already made up her mind about going. We had a few big arguments about it as we both felt so strongly about the situation but eventually I backed down, as I could see the decision had already been made, not before letting her know that it had upset me as I felt like she was going back on her word, not to mention I had plans for our summer together that now had to be scrapped.\\n\\nIn the few months leading up to her departure I managed to push it to the back of my mind and be mature about it (\"whatever is best for her is best for us\", \"as long as she\\'s happy I\\'m happy\" and all that), but I feel like I may have just accidentally fooled her into thinking that I was now OK with her going again.\\n\\nSo she\\'s now away at camp and luckily we\\'ve managed to work out a schedule in between my work hours and her work ours where we can talk most days for half an hour or so. The chats have mostly been positive, with us just catching up and filling each other in, supporting each other and things. However, these past few days I\\'ve begun to feel bored/lonely again and have started to resent her as I feel that it\\'s her fault as I don\\'t feel like this when we\\'re together. So yesterday I kinda blew up at her and got a bit jealous and had a go at her for joking around about sunbathing topless (which I think is wrong for someone in a relationship to do) and sent her a few long text messages telling her how I feel and kind of having a go at her for going and saying I think she made a mistake (I do feel bad cause I think I may have gone a little over the top as I belittled her job and said it wasn\\'t really a proper job - which I regret). I also said that she has gone too far this time and am not sure if things can go back to normal (not sure that I actually believe that but I got carried away in the heat of the moment) and I think I really upset her.\\n\\nSo yeah, I kinda regret some of the things I said in the heat of it but at the same time I did just say how I was feeling. I hope and don\\'t THINK I\\'ve been an asshole as I can\\'t help how I feel and I\\'ve just told her how it makes me feel, but I just want to get the impartial opinions of you guys and maybe some advice on how I could make things better for us both.

Husband says yes I should have known better.   \\n\\nI used to work at a nonprofit that does work in India, and quit recently because they needed more time than I could give.  I recently read \"Beyond the Beautiful Forevers,\" which is about life an a slum in Mumbai and a lot about the corruption in India.  There is a part about the people in the slums using corrupt methods to get money from Western charities and use it for different purposes.  According to this book, and in fact some of our experience doing business in India, bribes and corruption aren\\'t just part of the fabric of the culture and economy there - they ARE the culture and economy, and it made me really question whether charity work can be done *at all* in the way we try to do it from the US.  \\n\\nSo I posted about it on FB (in a general sense, not mentioning my former job although everyone knows what it was and why the topic was interesting to me).  Someone asked specifically about my former org, and I responded \"I have no idea...I have met the staff from India and they seem professional and like they are doing a good job, and we have checks and balances and good governance in place because we do have experience with corruption in India, but if EVERYONE is in cahoots, as it seems they are from this book, then there\\'s no real way to know, is there?\"    I was being honest.  I wasn\\'t a marketing person, don\\'t do spin, and I was mostly just reacting to this very disturbing book in what I consider a somewhat personal, not professional venue.    There were a lot of serious responses, including one from a friend who does mission work in Kenya, agreeing about the difficulty of working in a corrupt country where you really can\\'t tell.\\n\\nSo my former boss responds to that thread,  asking if I\\'m doing drugs or drinking a lot in a really nasty, confrontational way, and I responded to her, all earnest, saying that the book was really disturbing and it was making me think a lot and reframe in my mind stuff that I thought was one way, but that could have been completely different...and she called me and yelled that I was saying to the whole world that everything she had been working on and for for the last 6 years was a lie.  I tried to respond that no, I wasn\\'t saying that *at all* but she was too pissed and hung up on me after saying some really nasty stuff.  I tried to apologize and ended up deleting the entire post but I feel like shit.  \\n\\nI don\\'t use Facebook for professional stuff *at all,* even though they tried for years to make us post their marketing campaigns and solicit for donations through our personal social media.  To ME, Facebook is a place to share thoughts, books, have conversations (light and heavy) and I was using it that way.  Was I an asshole or just should have known better or was that fine and she overreacted because I hit a nerve?  AITA?  \\n\\nEDIT:  Thanks guys, I ended up deleting the post and posting an apology/explanation, saying that I didn\\'t intend to question our staff or organization.

[See this for an insight on our relationship - Obviously this is one instance but imagine her..naivety? towards every other aspects of our lives. And to clear up it didn't turn out to be 150/month to my bank and 500/month to her bank that was back dated but I still feel like that money should've gone towards clearing debt - She bought herself a load of fucking clothes n shit.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/388a2g/me_20_m_with_my_girlfriend_19f_for_over_a_year/)\\n\\nAnyway, I don't want to go on about the past - I don't think she ever did any of these things on purpose. I'm pretty sure her mums just been whispering in her ear and manipulating her. Now, where was I.\\n\\nSo we've broken up, and she's taken our son to her mums and is currently living there. Fair enough you know, I work, she's not gonna leave him with me. The first week after we broke up things were rocky but we were actually talking and getting on better than we had done in months. Then I started doing things that she didn't like (That she was aware I was going to do). \\n\\nFirst one - Cancelling the aforementioned claim. This claim was in my name and dependent on my circumstance, she was aware that I was cancelling it - I had no choice, I would've been liable to pay it back if I kept receiving it. So after that, she started getting shitty with me, fair enough I guess, told her explicitly that I had no choice and would be more than happy to give her whatever she needs for our son. She said she was worried about money now, understandable because of her insane spending habits. As soon as she started receiving this money which turned out to be £65/week she'd just buy crap. She started this new hobby and had spent about £150/£200 on it that we really didn't have but hey she was getting that money and it was out of my control. I said to her as long as you've got enough to get stuff for him and you then spend the rest on what you want (Begrudgingly, I really wanted to start saving that money so we could move out and get a bigger house - But hey with the way things have gone, I don't think that was part of her plan anyway!). \\n\\nI understood that it must suck having no money (neither did I, it all went on bills and us) but at least I saw money coming in and out of my bank, so I kept my mouth shut. Next one - I was paying her phone bill and gym membership. Now, I did initially say after we broke up that I would continue paying them, and give her money for him, until she sorted everything out. Then, I went to pick him up from her mums and noticed the name for our version of child support 'CSA' written across her mums fridge. I was literally shaking with rage when I saw it, but didn't kick off. I asked her if there was a reason that was up there and she said that she had to go through them - Maybe she did, I don't know. She was applying for other forms of welfare and that might have kicked off that process. It wasn't the fact that she was doing it. It was that she was doing it, AND, hadn't told me. \\n\\nIf I hadn't seen that, I'd have been paying her phone, gym membership, and that when it comes through. I'm liable to pay CSA from when she gets in touch with them - They backdate it. So this, literally, would've left me in debt, as I can't afford all 3 and all of my own outgoings. So the next day, I told her that I'd cancelled her phone and membership. INITIALLY, I wasn't even going to do this just yet, I was going to wait because I thought she might stop me from seeing him over the weekend. But her and her mum were having a.. public exchange over facebook calling me psycho and stuff and I saw it and again, it filled me with rage. I'd been nothing but honest and fair about all of this situation, she'd started doing all of these things behind my back, and I'd just had enough. \\n\\nSo I text her (after I'd done it) saying that I'd stopped paying her gym membership and that they'd suspended the payment until she could sort it out - This was good, didn't want to leave her in debt. And I said that I wanted to transfer the phone over to her by the end of the next week or I would be cancelling it too. Obviously, she did not take too kindly to this, told me I wasn't having her number, told me to stop playing games, and blocked me on facebook. Now, I'm trying to see this from her side of things, but I don't know how any rational mind can justify any of that. So, yeah, that happened. \\n\\nEeeeeeeven after all of this, still tried to be friendly and get on. Now, I've got no way to talk to her, so we can't argue, good in a sense, bad because the arrangement she had given me before blocking me was seeing him 2 evenings a week and half a day over the weekend. I do not, and still do not, accept this as good enough. When I had him, he slept half of the time, so I was seeing him 5 hours over the week. This is not good enough. I can not form a bond with my son with this time. I told her this, she didn't care. Again, no way to dispute it, she's the mother. Just got to get on with it. So that week I stick to it, pick him up, exchange pleasantries. And to be honest, we were being civil with each other. I was happy with the way things were between us, but not happy with what she'd given me for him. I love my little boy. He's my world. I know a lot of other young dads who do not give a fuck about their sons and their ex's always pest them to get them to see their kids. Anyway, this arrangement stands for a week. Now comes last weekend. I'm walking with my mates to go out, and I see her and her mum walking up town dressed up. I think to myself 'wtf? where's my son, where are you going, why haven't you asked me to watch him' didn't say a word, tried to force a smile through my pissed off expression. turns out she went out for the night and left our infant son with her fucking kid brother for the night. \\n\\nMan, I am soooo pissed I don't have the words. Now, just to try and chime her side of things in here. Her brother is more than capable of watching our son, in a controlled safe environment, I am not comfortable with him watching our son whilst she goes out and gets drunk, if anything goes wrong, where the short time after something going wrong could be life or death, he would have absolutely.no.fucking.idea. what to do. He'd be ringing her up or his mom, not the emergency services. He's a fucking child. So now I'm nervous. and pissed off. My friends and I meet our friends, and I tell them that I've just seen my ex and her mum walking up town, don't know where our son is, and presuming her brother is watching him. I tell them that if I see her later on, I will be leaving, as it's only going to result in a fight. So the night goes on, I try to forget about everything and enjoy myself. Low and behold, about midnight (6 hours after seeing her walk up town) I see her up town, she comes up to me, drunk, trying to hide it, and I say to her 'Just wondering, who's watching our son?' she tells me her brother, so I say alright fair enough. Then get up and leave with a couple of my friends. \\n\\nMorning comes around, she rings me and wakes me up. Says 'Good morning, you're not having him today because of your behaviour' I'm like wtF? I haven't done anything. And she says loads of people came up to her saying I'd been slagging her off. Now, I hadn't, I'm not like that, I cba holding grudges, it's too much effort. I did however tell people the truth, that I saw her walking up town etc, because I would be leaving if I saw her and didn't want people asking me what was up. Further to this point, I pulled one of my mates aside later that day and asked if anyone said anything to her about me and he said that whilst he was there no one even mentioned me to her. \\n\\nWhat I'm imagining is someone said to her 'Where's your kid? Why isn't the father watching him?' (Removed names lol almost fucked up) So yeah, there's that. So (yesterday) I didn't get to see him. So last week I spent 6 hours with him and he slept 3 of them. It fucking sucks. And I've had enough. She's got a lot of issues, and has a very traumatic past, and I understand that she is being protective of him, but I do not in any way see how she thinks doing all of this is in his best intersests. For some reason she thinks I'm incapable of looking after him. I am capable of looking after him, when we were together she did nothing but sing my praises to everyone. \\n\\nThe break up was a mutual decision and she decided to leave. I'd understand her being like this if I left her, but I didn't. She even said to me that she'd been planning on leaving anyway. Fair enough - So had I as mentioned in the link above. I just don't get it. She's left me with no choice, right?

We became friends via being in the same classes in our local Polytechnic. \\n\\nThere is this guy whom I say call as \\'Luke\\' who is the oldest among us. He have a rather poor habit of having poor time management and impatient too, meaning that he would frequently make us wait for him and would kick up a fuss if we don\\'t while similarly kicking up a fuss if either one of us is late. Now I won\\'t call this a big issue since I find the rest of my friends to have the same tendency too.\\n\\nAnother thing is that Luke also dislike us meeting other friends instead of \\'our group\\'. I feel that this sometimes put me in a tight spot because I like to hang out with my other group of friends and partner from time to time. The rest are sometimes given remarks for meeting their other friends too and are annoyed. At this point I should make it clear that he is not shy of making other friends and in fact has other social circles too that we do not bash him for when he meets them.\\n\\nSo one day the last straw was had when another guy from the group (Let\\'s call him \\'Ben\\') decides to meet up with Luke for dinner. After waiting for 2 hours, Ben got fed up and left. This was the third time it happen and the group finally decided to ignore and separate away from him.\\n\\nAs for me, I never dealt with the lateness before (He is always on time when meeting me and if he did happen to be late, he would offer to drive me home.) and his little remarks about me meeting others did not bother me at all as I myself understand that it is sometimes disappointing to see your friends choosing to meet others instead of you. So I continued to chat with him and meet up for lunch or supper from time to time. \\n\\nNow the issue:\\n\\nBen\\'s group now heard about it and seem to be upset about my \\'betrayal\\' despite me still hanging out and eating with them the whole time. I told them that what Luke did wasn\\'t an issue to me as he personally did not upset me in anyway and I do not want to break a friendship just because I had to choose a side. They seem to accept my stance on the matter but would keep on making remarks about me being friends with Luke.\\n\\nA month since it all started has passed and I am still spending my time with both sides, though I had decided to spend more time with a group of friends who share similar passions and my partner.\\nBoth sides just feels so \\'lame\\' with their constant badmouthing and remarks but I sometimes wonder if I was the asshole in choosing not to be sympathetic and not selecting a side to be with.\\n\\nSo tell me dear /u/, should I have picked a side? Was I doing the right thing by staying away from it? Or maybe I was an asshole for telling someone who is upset with the other that I shall still be friends with him because I do not face the same issues?\\n\\n(Sorry for the long post &gt;&lt;\")\\n\\nEDIT:\\n\\nTLDR; Friend perceived as an asshole is now \\'kicked\\' from the group, I still stay friends with both side because it is not my issue and now the group keeps taunting me about it and treats me as a \\'betrayer\\'.', 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA for not bothering?', 'url': 'http://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3da24y/aita_for_not_bothering/'}, {'author': 'jirt282', 'author_created_utc': 1436906542, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'author_fullname': 't2_ostvr', 'created_utc': 1436906738, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'edited': 1436907909, 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3darns/aita_for_wanting_to_be_liked/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '3darns', 'is_self': True, 'link_flair_css_class': 'not', 'link_flair_text': 'not the asshole', 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 10, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3darns/aita_for_wanting_to_be_liked/', 'retrieved_on': 1440611459, 'score': 4, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': 'My friend of 3 years hasn\\'t been speaking to me a lot lately.

Finally today, after a comment thread on FB with other people as well, he tells me we can\\'t hang out one on one bc he\\'s a guy and I\\'m a girl and he doesn\\'t want to hurt his new girlfriend. He says it in a condescending way that implies he doesn\\'t want to see me at all any more so I replied a little snarkily that I had been wanting to hang out in a group and that if he didn\\'t want to be friends any more I would have appreciated prior notice before he started acting like this and ignoring my texts. I thought he was just being a little rude and it would blow over in five minutes. Then he proceeded to tell me that in fact he didn\\'t want to be friends any more because I\\'m a bad influence on him. He says I am a flirt and that I enjoy the social influence that buys me. He also says I am manipulative and play mind games with people and have hurt a lot of my friends, and that it feels like I\\'ve been trying to keep him and his girlfriend apart.\\n\\nHe gave me no specific examples of who I had hurt or what I had specifically said. I have been told that I come across as a flirt before, but my personality is just to be friendly with people and joke around and tease them-- I\\'m not being touchy-feely with them, or complimenting their appearance, or anything like that, just trying to be friendly and banter. But nobody except him has accused me of doing that on purpose to have more power over people or to hurt them. As for his relationship, I\\'ve let him literally cry on my shoulder about this girl. I\\'ve suggested before when they were broken up that maybe he should move on but told him that it was his decision to make and that I would support him no matter what.\\n\\nI will admit that I do work really hard to try and be a charming and well-liked person. I have tried to become better friends with \"cool\" people because I\\'m tired of being seen as a super weird girl and a loser. I don\\'t think that I\\'m better than other people who are nerdy and stuff-- I freely admit I\\'m a huge nerd and most of my friends are as well. And those are the people I still spend the vast majority of my time with.

Sometimes when I do nice things I don\\'t do them just because I want to be helpful, but because I want a better relationship with the person or because I want to be a good person and want to be known for that.\\n\\nAnd I\\'m really afraid that that makes me a manipulator, or that I really am hurting everybody I know all the time and they just don\\'t tell me. I have been confronted before when I have done something specific to someone and immediately apologized and worked to fix things, but it has not been for anything this guy is talking about. I asked other friends about this situation and they all said that no, I\\'m not manipulative and that this guy is being mean, but I really just want an outside perspective. I\\'m losing our entire friendship over this until he decides I\\'m a better person (yes, he said that). We have the same friend groups, we\\'re on the same quiz team, and we\\'re in the same social club, so all of this is going to be messy and awkward and I don\\'t know what to do now.

In the group project it was very obvious who had done the work due to the nature of version control - it literally says who 'uploaded' the work to the online repository. \\n\\nThroughout and when the project was finished, unsurprisingly to me, he had not pulled his weight within the team, only having done the simplest of tasks from our storyboard.

This is a long thread, so grab some popcorn and have fun judging (if it\\'s important, the city is NYC):\\n\\nMONDAY \\n\\nSam: Here\\'s a new one: homeless guy at Frozen Yogurt Place pulling the handles and eating the froyo out of his hand\\n\\nTaylor: It\\'s sort of brilliant. What flavor was he getting?\\n\\nSam: Birthday cake of course. I was disgusted.\\n\\nTaylor: There is a homeless man who always hangs out outside of my bagel shop. He just stands there looking completely catatonic and I want to buy him a bagel every day but I\\'m scared of him. Like I don\\'t want him to follow me. But I also think it would probably do him wonders to know someone cares about him. \\n\\nSam: I\\'m so disgusted by them all. I have absolutely no sympathy whatsoever. Just too many around the city\\n\\nTaylor: Most of them are very sick\\n\\nSam: Yes, that\\'s true and a problem. I just can\\'t stand the one per day at least on my train asking for money. \\n\\nSam: [sends picture of man sleeping in breezeway of bank where ATMs are] This was last week: someone sleeping inside the bank across the street. \\n\\nTaylor: I\\'d rather not have homeless people all about. It makes me feel unsafe, because I know they are likely mentally ill, but also very desperate. But I think as human beings, we\\'re called to have a little compassion.\\n\\nSam: Have you ever run into a hostile one on the train? Not pleasant\\n\\nTaylor: I know it\\'s not. I don\\'t want to deal with it any more than you do. But I don\\'t know, to hear that you feel no sympathy and that you\\'re disgusted makes me sad.\\n\\nSam: Not true of the mentally ill ones. That\\'s a sickness. But a large portion seem to be just fine asking for money on the same train multiple times a week with the same sob story. \\n\\nSam: Anyway, do you like Indian food?\\n\\nTaylor: I\\'ve never really had Indian food\\n\\nSam: Neither have I but I\\'m curious\\n\\nSam: Would you want to try it sometime? It\\'s got to be vegetarian-friendly\\n\\nTaylor: I would try it...if you\\'ll try volunteering at the homeless shelter with me some weekend\\n\\nSam: I\\'m not opposed to it. How are they related though?\\n\\nTaylor: Because how the poor are treated is important to me. We both want the same thing...less people on the streets, less begging...so why not be proactive about it? Do something good to help people? \\n\\nSam: I feel the poor &amp; working are much different than the poor and refusing to work. And again, mentally ill notwithstanding. \\n\\nTaylor: I agree, but it\\'s a pretty strong statement to say you have zero sympathy and all disgust you. I sincerely doubt that guy sleeping in a bank is just refusing to work. I also think just think a lot of the time people have issues that we don\\'t understand. Anyway, all I\\'m saying is I have felt strongly compelled to help the poor lately. I actually was planning on calling the shelter to set up a time to volunteer anyway this week. So let\\'s do something nice for others bc both of us are pretty fortunate\\n\\nSam: Part of me does want to always help those who are less fortunate. But another part says, \"get a job.\" That\\'s the no sympathy part. If millions of immigrants can come here illegally and work hard selling fruit along the highway, so can the dummy on the train \\n\\nTaylor: We just don\\'t know the circumstances of these people. Plenty of people abuse the system. And that, in my opinion, is gross. But there are plenty of people who seem fine who truly can\\'t get a job [redacted because of a personal story]. I\\'m not saying every person is a sob story, nd there are definitely gross, horrible people out there, but defaulting to place of no compassion isn\\'t a good look for anyone. \\n\\nSam: I was very clear that any mental disability is notwithstanding. You\\'re giving a free pass to too many who just refuse to work. Ride the train with me sometime and we\\'ll count how many are qualified to sell fruit on the highway. It\\'ll be 9 out of 10. \\n\\nTaylor: I\\'m not giving a free pass to anyone. I am saying that it\\'s our job to be compassionate human beings and do what we can take make sure our fellow humans are treated with dignity. I\\'m not saying handouts, I\\'m just advocating for not judging and not looking at people we don\\'t know with disgust because we don\\'t know their story. That\\'s all. \\n\\nSam: Well I bet your compassion level would be muuuuch different if you rode 4 trains a day in the city, or lived on the street that the guy pissed in the middle of on the front of the Post yesterday, or needed to use that ATM in the picture I sent. Much different when it\\'s in your face every day. \\n\\nTaylor: Do you think those people are mentally sound? I would guess those people need a lot of help. \\n\\nSam: There are definitely two different categories. I just have no sympathy for the large group that refuses to help themselves. And they are everywhere. \\n\\n\\nTHURSDAY\\n\\nSam: Saw the BAND NAME at Venue last night with _______. Only other time I\\'ve seen them was with you at Another Venue. \\n\\nTaylor: Nice\\n\\nSam: Off to Italy right now. See you in a couple of weeks?\\n\\nTaylor: Have fun\\n\\nSam: Those aren\\'t your normal enthusiastic texts. Why?\\n\\nTaylor: You wouldn\\'t be asking the question if you didn\\'t have some idea why. Honestly, those things you said really bothered me. I\\'m sure I\\'ll be over it by the time you get back. I\\'m just not over it right now. \\n\\nSam: It\\'s a difference of opinion on a social issue. You\\'ve never had that happen before? I\\'ve got good friends who think Obama is the equivalent to Satan and born in Kenya. \\n\\nTaylor: I don\\'t think it\\'s a social issue. I think it\\'s a deeply rooted value. We could disagree all day long on abortion, politics, criminalizing drug use...whatever. But a lack of empathy for fellow humans is way deeper than any of that. And I\\'m trying not to be brash, I think your Italy trip is well-timed and I can cool off before saying anything stupid\\n\\nSam: So you think I have no empathy for fellow humans? That\\'s beyond stupid. Where are you getting that from?\\n\\nTaylor: \"I\\'m so disgusted by them all. I have absolutely no sympathy whatsoever.\"\\n\\nSam: So you take one half-serious text and accuse me of having no empathy for fellow humans? I then explained my ACTUAL opinions quite thoroughly. You either misread that or need to get off your pedestal. We have the EXACT same level of caring for others. \\n\\nTaylor: I\\'m not on any pedestal. But your comments hurled you off the one I had you on. I don\\'t want to fight, I just need time to cool off because if you were joking it was still extremely offensive\\n\\nSam: So what\\'s more offensive? A simple joke or accusing a friend of lack of character? You tell me. \\n\\nTaylor: This is why I didn\\'t want to talk about this now \\n\\nSam: Why not? It\\'s how you feel. And when I said I wasn\\'t opposed to joining you at the shelter (actually like the idea), did you just choose to ignore that part when you were passing judgement on my character? \\n\\nTaylor: Because I wanted time to cool off. \\n\\nSam: Haha, cool off from what? We were discussing a social issue like adults do and you turned it into a moral issue. So what\\'s next? I\\'m pro choice, so I have no empathy for babies? \\n\\nTaylor: This is why I wanted to take a step back, so I could better discern emotion and logic. Do you REALLY want to have this out right now?\\n\\nSam: I\\'ve already stated my case several times. I\\'m good as long as you realize how offensive that is to judge someone\\'s entire character like that. Luckily, I have very thick skin.\\n\\nTaylor: Do you realize it\\'s offensive to call people disgusting without understanding their life situation and where they came from?\\n\\nSam: What part of \"joke\" did you not get? I\\'ve stated my true opinions. If I had known that you couldn\\'t take a joke and were the moral defender of all less fortunate, I wouldn\\'t have joked. You have to admit, to say I have no empathy for fellow humans is a ridiculous statement. \\n\\nTaylor: Ok. It was a joke. I\\'ll accept it.

Tonight we were doing the Prison Break Heist in Grand Theft Auto V because it provides double the GTA$ this weekend. \\n\\nIn the heist finale the heist leader can choose the final cut for each heist member. The first time we played through the heist we were doing (March 12th), I was the host and made everyone get an equal cut (25%) which was actually a better deal for them. To start the heist it requires an investment of $40,000 and the heist leader doesn't get any money during the Heist Setup missions (four for this heist), while all other players receive about $19,000 per setup. This means that I was at $-40,000 while all of them are at about $76,000. The heist itself pays $500,000 normally and at 25% each that means that everyone gets $125,000. \\n\\nIn total I received $85,000 while they receive about $201,000 during the first time we played through the heist.\\n\\nThis weekend the Heist Setups and Heist Finale pay double, so we were playing them again. My friend had the most money so we voted him to pay the $40,000 to start the heist, which also stops him from getting the double cash for each setup. Through the setups we receive $152,000 ($38,000 per setup) and he stays at $-40,000. \\n\\nWhen we arrive at the Heist Finale I request that he make it so that everyone's cut be 25% of the $1,000,000 (double the original). This would mean that the totals are $402,000 for me and two others while he receives $210,000. He didn't like this and didn't do it, so we refused to start and didn't ready up. There is a five minute lobby timer and that causes the mission to auto-start, so we leave. This unknowingly charges him another $40,000. He restarts it and he still refuses, so we left again. After a third time (about 15 minutes later) he kicks me and invites another friend who is in our party. They start without me and once I leave he gives in and gives everyone 25%.\\n\\nI was offended by the fact that I had given everyone 25% before and he wouldn't do the same even though he had more money than everyone else. He instead wanted to give everyone else 20% and give himself 40%. He said that I didn't give him 25% the first time, but I had evidence in my trophy history (there is a trophy for giving everyone 25% and one for completing the heist that I both received on 3/12/15 at 11:06 PM). His next defense was to give me 25%, but our other two friends only 20%, which I still found unfair and refused to continue unless everyone had 25%.\\n\\nAs a result of this argument and previous times where I had manipulated him in a different game (Civilization V, in which war is just as much psychological as it is done through the game) he kicked me from the lobby and invited our other friend. Once he did this I complained and blocked him on almost every way I could think of (His phone number, Twitter, Steam, PSN, Instagram, Skype, etc.). \\n\\nMy way of thinking was that if he didn't return the favor for something I did, then he isn't the type of person I want to be friends with. Now I'm starting to feel like a bad person though because he was one of my good friends and we have been talking every night and playing games and tennis for years. I'm considering unblocking him and making up. I'm beginning to regret my decision, but I always stick to my guns at least a little beyond the point where he begins to complain.

We\\'re in college now but we met in our Junior year of high school. I consider us best friends. We\\'re both into gaming and all that, and we both started our first jobs around the same time. Because of his schedule, he wasn\\'t able to volunteer at a convention with Melissa and I. I asked him a couple of months in advance if he\\'d have a problem with us doing it, and he said no.  \\nIt was a really good time. Mel and I manned the console section to make sure nothing was stolen. We got to meet a lot of \"celebrities.\" It was an incredibly cool experience and one in particular went out of his way to be really nice to us and chat with us. It was crazy humbling. \\nThere was an after-party at the convention for volunteers and guests and people who payed a bit more to get in. It was lame, and Mel and I just hung out waving glow sticks around. The streamer we met was there, but didn\\'t say a word to us other than \"thanks\" when we brought him some chairs for his crew.   \\nAlcohol was expensive so I didn\\'t even drink. The music was loud and bad so Mel and I left very shortly after arriving.  \\nAfter the convention was over I was really amped up about all the people I met and saw. I told Jake everything about what we did, the other volunteers, the party, and the nice streamer. He seemed cheerful about all of it but said    \\n\"wow, it seems like you totally have a crush on that guy.\"    \\nI bluntly said \"Of course I do! He\\'s gorgeous.\"    \\nI didn\\'t think it\\'d upset Jake because I have a lot of \"movie star\" crushes. I joke about wishing I had a hot uncle Jesse and about Tony Stark. He picked on me about them a lot and never seemed threatened. He laughed when I said that about the steamer, even.   \\nBut yesterday we went out for his birthday dinner with his family. His stepsiblings are also into gaming so I was telling them about TMG, and again, the people I met. Jake didn\\'t seem bothered and joined in the discussion.   \\nWhen we got home he told me I embarrassed him because no one knew who the streamer was and I sounded like a girl meeting a boyband. Which is true. He kept pressing me to apologize.    \\n\"I don\\'t see the need to apologize if I didn\\'t know it\\'d upset you.\"   \\n\"Just say it and we can get over this and go to bed.\"   \\nI was wondering why he was so persistent, so I pressed.   \\n\"Are you just jealous?\"    \\nHe finally admitted to it, \"So what if I am. You talk about him all the time. I had to work while you were alone with him at some party all weekend and it made me super uncomfortable.\"   \\n\"You didn\\'t say you were upset at all!\"   \\n\"That shouldn\\'t matter. I shouldn\\'t even have to tell you I\\'m jealous, just the fact that it upset me should be enough for you to apologize.\"   \\n\"I was confused, and being embarrassed of me and jealous are two really different things.. I had no idea you felt like this.\"      \\n\"To you, you do nothing wrong. Just say sorry.\"    \\n\"Sorry..\"\\n\"Now it\\'s really not good enough..\"   \\n\\nAnd it went on like that for a while. I feel like a total cunt. I feel like I ruined his birthday and I feel guilty for volunteering without him. I feel guilty for going to the party and I feel guilty for texting him so often at the convention about all the fun we had.    \\nNow he\\'s giving me the silent treatment and I have no idea what to do. He went to a picnic with his family an hour or so ago and didn\\'t invite me and I just feel pissed because I don\\'t know what else I can do.

My dog in response begins stumbling away down the nearest driveway, obviously hurt, and yet the doberman continues his assault. Eventually the lady who owned the doberman strolled into the scene.

This coworker is technically the assistant branch manager but in our small branch that doesn\\'t mean much, but it doesn\\'t mean much mainly because he\\'s a lazy fuck. Now Bob has been friends with my family for as long as I can remember so keep that in mind. Bob used to work at another location for the same company where he was known for being lazy. He was moved to my location to prevent him from being under the scope of the owner, I guess because out of sight, out of mind. \\n\\nI have a cousin who works part time with us, let\\'s call him Tom. Tom works his ass off, he\\'s technically just a warehouse worker but he helps with sales and customer service things as well. He basically goes above and beyond at work when needed. Tom wants to work full time but was told by our Regional Manager (who is my father) that Tom can\\'t be full time unless Bob or I was no longer there. \\n\\nOur branch manager (let\\'s call him Sam) has also known Bob for quite a long time, so he would never speak ill or do what I want to do to Bob. Sam is too nice of a person to do anything drastic and it makes me feel really bad for him. Sam works beyond hard to carry the weight of Bob. I spoke with Sam on the phone for about a half hour, and he is just as frustrated as I am. \\n\\nI want to talk to our Regional Manager (my father) and let him know how much of a lazy prick Bob is and that Tom clearly deserves to go full time over Bob. This will surely cause immense drama and perhaps burn bridges. But at this point Bob has pissed me off way too many times and I haven\\'t gone to my father before because I haven\\'t had any other reason to do so. Now I feel I should go to him because someone deserves the job more. \\n\\nMy main concern is the bridges that will be burned if Bob gets fired. There are many mutual friends between us and there will definitely be issues in that aspect. I feel bad for my branch manager and I want to lighten his work load. \\n\\nSome minor things that Bob does that really annoys me. Bob will go out for an occasional delivery, spends extra time doing who knows what, comes back with lunch for himself, didn\\'t call us back at the branch to ask if we wanted anything. Then if I go out on a delivery and get lunch for myself (this is rare, usually I\\'ll call) he talks shit about not calling him to see if he wanted something. Bob takes at least one 10-15 minute bathroom break every couple of hours. You think the least he can do since he\\'s in the bathroom so often is clean the bathroom, but no, I\\'ve never seen him do any of that. Bob will ignore customer phone calls if he sees that the caller ID is someone he\\'d prefer not to talk to. Bob will not help us if there is a store full of customers, he might instead watch videos on his phone in the back, or maybe even take a 10 minute phone call while strolling around the warehouse. None of us clock out for lunch, so usually we\\'ll try and cover each other while the others eat. Bob will take 15-20 minutes to go and get his lunch, another 15-20 to eat his lunch, and finally to wrap it up he\\'ll spend another 15-20 minutes in the bathroom afterwards. Meanwhile, when we\\'re eating he\\'s on one of his strolls around the warehouse or his common hangout spot, the bathroom, leaving us to frequently step away from our lunch and help a customer. \\n\\nTo kind of give Bob\\'s POV to the best of my ability. Bob used to work at another company, my father I believe matched his pay and hired him at this job instead. Often times I\\'ll hear Bob say things like, \"If I was still working at \\'so and so\\' I\\'d be making this much money\". So Bob clearly isn\\'t happy with his wage which I can only imagine can\\'t be that bad (probably way more than me). He\\'s got a 401k, health insurance, profit sharing, etc. What else can I really say, Bob occasionally works. But for the most part I don\\'t know why he is the way he is. I assume he won\\'t quit because he wouldn\\'t be able to find a better job at this point (he\\'s in his mid 40\\'s).\\n\\nWow that\\'s a long post. Sorry for any grammatical errors and possible format issues (wrote this on mobile). I hope I gave enough relevant information without getting too wordy. I\\'m looking for some insight from others I guess, I tried to give both sides but honestly this guy is a jerk. Let me know if you need any clarifications and I\\'ll do my best to make timely responses. Am I the asshole?\\n\\nTL;DR I have a coworker/family friend that is lazy. I want to replace him with my cousin who works hard. Worried about burning bridges between mutual friends.

While at our small town bar, and into our third pints, our conversation lulled. Mike asked what I was thinking about. I stupidly let slip some hopes I had for future achievements. His response was a smirk and a nod. Since we have known each other for over a decade, I figured what the hell and asked for his candid thoughts. He is usually pessimistic but I was not expecting such a negative view on what I am passionate about and honestly feel I am pretty good at. He ripped me a new one in the quality of my work, and then went on to tell me what a sham he thought I was. I was kind of stunned, as I was expecting at worst some critical but objective views on what I had just shared and this hostility and contempt had not been so apparent to me until that moment. We both struggle with depression, and have both been unemployed at various times in the past two years while living back at home with our parents.  I\\'ve listened to his plans for advancing in life and have tried to be encouraging, but after feeling attacked by his response I felt that I needed to defend myself. \\nMy response: \"And what do YOU do?\"\\nHis response: \"I work.\"\\nAt this point I believe the bartender, who is a dear relative of Mike, walked in on our conversation and perceived the edge of my tone to be condescending to Mike\\'s place in life. I tried to to make clear to my friend, that what I said was meant to reference ambition, and not the mutual disapointments we had experienced in the years since we graduated from high school. I don\\'t think I convinced him that I was not trying to belittle his progress. We started to argue since I couldn\\'t let go of the slight he made. This led to him concluding was that we were both \"terrible\" people.

Due to our anger and lack of communication with all of us, we organized a meeting a couple of weeks ago to talk out our issues with each other. \\n\\nAt this \"meeting\" I told my friend that it\\'s annoying that I can\\'t talk to him when he is constantly texting his girlfriend, because it\\'s in one ear and out the other. Every single time I am with him he is texting his girlfriend, and whatever she has to say is always more important that the people he is with. She\\'s a junior in high school and to me, is very clingy. I wish I could communicate just HOW OFTEN HE TEXTS HER, even when he is with me and the rest of our group. Anyways, at this meeting he agreed with me and promised to stop and that he would live in the moment with his friends, and not constantly be texting her.\\n\\nI guess that went in one ear and out the other because last night we went to see the movie Southpaw (one of the best movies I\\'ve ever seen, might I add) and he was texting her the whole fucking time! Every 5 seconds I would see his screen light up, and he would tap away texting her back. I called him out on it after the movie and he claimed that he only did it during the boring parts. I was especially bothered because I paid for his movie ticket. I always buy for him because he can\\'t afford the things we do, and I can. His constant texting of her, even after we have spoken about it, annoys the shit out of me.\\n\\nSo today he texted me asking if I wanted to go to dinner tonight. I told him sure. Five minutes later he texted back saying that his girlfriend\\'s parents thought he was going with them tonight, so he told me that he couldn\\'t have dinner tonight, and tried to make it funny. I replied with a \"Fuck you\" and \"You\\'re a dick.\" and he replied with two texts, one saying \"Okay\" and the other saying \"My bad, I\\'m sorry I thought I wasn\\'t going to.\" Perhaps I was being too hard but it might be part of this built up anger that his girlfriend takes priority over everything that is happening at a given time. Asked him after the movie what he was doing this weekend, he\\'s going to hang out with his girlfriend every night this weekend. It\\'s annoying the shit out of me.

(his car isn\\'t in the front\"\\nU: \"Really, just dump it in the bin\"\\nM: \"Fine whatever\"\\n\\nMy uncle came home and I asked him where my aunt went and he asked me about that smartass comment and I told him he had sent me one (starting his text off with really, and I can just picture him saying it, as if any questions I have are a bother and that I should just know whether I\\'m supposed to steal my neighbor\\'s green tote. My main concern is that this neighbor mows his own lawn and I don\\'t wanna fill his green tote up if he\\'s gonna mow soon, and I feel bad just taking it without asking) he then went on about how I should\\'ve known and said that it\\'s all because I used to always have my headphones in and that my and my cousins used to always have our headphones in so they\\'d have to yell at us, which is complete bullshit because on weekends I go to my mom\\'s house and he\\'s gone all day and doesn\\'t get home till 6pm so there\\'s no way he\\'d be talking to anyone until then, I\\'m very rarely home during a time where he\\'d be talking to them, which he rarely does anyways. His defense is that I should\\'ve just known and that it\\'s my fault because I used to wear headphones all the time and said that we (my cousins and I) don\\'t know how to think for ourselves.\\n\\nMy uncle is so hard to work with, he tells me to do things I don\\'t know how to do, and then acts as if I should know how to do things that no one\\'s ever taught me before (I don\\'t have a dad so I don\\'t know how to do any \"manly\" things when it come to fixing stuff and things like that) He doesn\\'t show any thanks when I do anything, and he talks down to me. \\nOne day I was sick and my uncle had me pulling weeds for 6 hours in the morning, which might be why I got a sinus infection and soon after, an ear infection. \\n\\nMy aunt is better than my uncle in my opinion, my aunt once tried to kick me out of the house because I wanted to go to sleep, it was sometime around midnight, I was ready to go to sleep, and two of my younger cousins were asleep on the couch (I slept on one of two couches at that time) the third of my youngest cousins (like 3rd grade at the time) was watching TV, its a Saturday night I remember, so I told her to turn off the TV so I could go to bed, and I went to the bathroom to brush my teeth and heard her go to my aunt and uncle\\'s room and told them what I did, they called me in there and when I told them I just wanted to go to bed they told me that she was out there because they were watching something she couldn\\'t watch and she was waiting to go with them. I guess I must have been tired and irritated but I think I just repeated that I just wanted to go to sleep, they said that if I was playing games I\\'d still be up and that I was being disrespectful and my aunt told me to call my mom in the morning to pick me up, I slammed the hall closet door and set my \"bed\" up, that made them come into the living room, I laid down and was breathing heavily because I was angry, so my aunt took the blanket off of me and had at least an hour long conversation with my that started off about being respectful, they\\'re not respectful to me, and ended with them telling me that I need counseling for my anger, I don\\'t, besides, who would pay? And telling me that other people have it worse, because even though my dad left, some of my family lost their mom to heart problems and their dad to the prison system (being involved with selling drugs) so they were pretty much saying that I shouldn\\'t be complaining because other people had it worse and ended it with telling me that I could stay. \\n\\nMy mom never really took care of me, she worked during the day and didn\\'t get home till late at night, after I was already asleep, and my aunt worked nights, the same on that I live with now, so she took care of me during the day. My mom met my stepdad and we moved to Washington, she took care of me, but she didn\\'t REALLY take care of me, she watched me and fed me and made sure I had what I needed, but she didn\\'t take care of what should be basic needs for a child, we didn\\'t have insurance so I never saw a doctor or a dentist (my teeth are really bad). It\\'s come to the point where she takes care of me and kind of babies me in a way, by doing things like making me lunch, or doing my laundry, or handing me something so I don\\'t have to get up, all things I don\\'t really need, but I still don\\'t have my own doctor, haven\\'t seen a dentist in at least a year, and never really feel like I have someone to talk to about important things in life.\\n\\nGuess it\\'s time to talk about my dad, I don\\'t know much about him, haven\\'t seen him since I was 8 I think (yeah don\\'t actually remember) I tried contacting him, and I got a response, but it never actually mattered, he never made any attempt to contact me unless I contacted him first. Do you know how shitty that can make someone feel? To feel like half of the people that created the human that is you don\\'t actually give enough of a shit to pick up a phone or write a fuckin email, sorry reddit, but it hurts, and I don\\'t know why I would want to put in the effort to talk to someone who doesn\\'t want to at least meet me halfway.\\n\\nThat\\'s all I can really think of right now, I feel like my family has made me afraid to speak out for fear of being kicked out or having my words twisted or for simply being told that I should\\'ve known better and that I don\\'t know how to thing. Am I the asshole for wishing things were different? Am I the asshole for being annoyed at everything my uncle does? Am I the asshole for saying I hate or at least extremely dislike my family?

If anything is unclear please let me know and I\\'ll try to clarify.\\n\\nI am 23 years old, recently graduated from college, and currently living with my mother on the East Coast (USA). If it matters my parents are divorced and I am not living under my father\\'s roof. Recently my boyfriend and I decided that we want to move in together in California. This is a good move for me career-wise because I want to work in the biotech/pharma industry.\\n\\nI ask my father for advice frequently but he also gives a lot of unsolicited advice. He says that this is because he has an analytical problem-solving nature that he can\\'t shut off. He  thinks that I need to have interviews lined up in CA before moving there, otherwise I will drain my savings.\\n\\nIdeally I\\'d love to have interviews lined up before moving but I personally don\\'t think it\\'s realistic. Companies often don\\'t take applicants seriously if their address is on the other side of the country. I did apply to a lot of CA jobs during spring and never heard back from any of them. I was afraid that if I applied to more with my East Coast address it would be a waste. My father then suggested I put down an address of someone I know in CA, but I\\'d have to be able to fly down for interviews on short notice, which would also drain my savings.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I picked out a short-term lease apartment and he is willing to cover rent and other costs of living until I am employed. We made a budget. I have $8000 in savings that will be used on the security deposit and my plane ticket. The rest will be emergency funds. I do not expect my father to bail me out financially under any circumstances. I am not moving to CA for around a month, but I have started applying to jobs using the apartment\\'s address. My father wanted me to have interviews lined up before choosing an apartment.\\n\\nI fully explained my reasoning to my father and I can explain more of my reasoning if anyone asks. I do understand my father\\'s concerns and I know he\\'s trying to look out for me. I told him that I took time to think on his advice but I am not going to follow it and I would like to stop discussing it. He got angry and told me that was a very disrespectful thing for me to say.\\n\\nMy father thinks I was just too lazy to apply for jobs early because people in my generation have lazy attitudes. He said he felt it was his duty to \"slap that attitude in the face\". I found this very hurtful because I\\'d applied to tons of East Coast jobs before deciding to move to CA, so I\\'m clearly not too lazy to apply to jobs. At this point both of us were raising our voices. \\n\\nAt 9:40 during the argument I told him I needed to leave soon to feed cats I was pet sitting by 10:00. He wouldn\\'t drop the argument and I reminded him I needed to leave several times. The cats have special diets and need medicine, so by 10:40 I walked away from the argument, telling him I was already 40 minutes late to feed them. This is especially where I\\'m worried I was the asshole. But in my opinion it\\'s definitely an asshole move to not feed the cats.\\n\\n**TL;DR** I told my father that when he gives me unsolicited advice I will always listen and consider it. But if I end up choosing not to follow his advice I want him to respect my decision. His response was that this is very disrespectful to him. I ended up walking out mid-argument because I was pet sitting cats with special dietary needs and was already 40 minutes late to feed them. My father was aware that I had this responsibility.

Our lease is up in 2 days and his plan was to move out and find a place with his girlfriend. My plan was to move out and find another roommate. Last week he sends me a text saying he\\'s staying another month. This is ok for me since I hadn\\'t nailed down a new roommate or place yet either. \\n\\nMonday night (2 days ago) I come home from work to find our place chock full of moving boxes and new furniture. His girlfriend, who got evicted from her other place, is suddenly here living his room with the rest of her stuff strewn out throughout the apartment. AND her dog. He didn\\'t tell me because he, \"didn\\'t think I\\'d care.\"\\n\\nToday, nearing the end of the month, I wanted to confirm we\\'re splitting the rent 3 ways. They can both afford it; she\\'s actually the one with the job in the relationship (he has GI bill military income each month). He told me there was no way in hell that was happening because she\\'s his guest and not a tenant. I surveyed the massive piles of boxes and gestured but that only set him off further. Anyway, apparently that\\'s the end of the discussion. \\n\\nAm I the asshole here?\\n\\n----\\n\\nUpdate - She just got home and said the same thing he did. Visit to the leasing office first thing tomorrow.\\n\\n----\\n\\nUpdate 2, 7/30/15 10:50am\\n\\nI asked the leasing office to please send me a copy of the contract as they weren\\'t open yet this morning when the stopped by. The lovely lady very quickly accommodated and sent over the fine print. I mucked through the legalese and found these two exciting clauses:\\n\\n\"**34. PETS:** No pets are permitted without the prior written consent of the Landlord. Any such consent may be revoked at any time, with or without cause, by giving ten (10) days written notice. Except to the extent written permission is given, pets may not be brought upon the Premises, whether such pets belong to Resident(s) or to any other person. **The presence of any pets as to which written permission has not been given and is not currently in force, even if such pets are \"just visiting\", shall be deemed a material and incurable breach of this Lease and shall be cause for the service of a three-day notice terminating the tenancy.** This policy does not apply to service animals.\"\\n\\n\"**Visitors**\\n\\nTenant acknowledges that his guests are his responsibility that they will park in only designated parking areas and that they will adhere to all the apartment rules. Visitors are limited to a 5 days day stay. Visitors staying longer than 5 days days must notify Management in writing.\"\\n\\nCheckmate.\\n\\n----\\n\\nUpdate 3, 7/30/15 4:00pm\\n\\nRoommate obviously noticed the signs of me packing up and asked if I was moving out. I said I had nothing to say to him. I plan on talking to the leasing people tomorrow. He came back an hour later and said, \"Just so you know, if you don\\'t pay August rent I will sue you in Small Claims Court.\"\\n\\nI told him to have a nice day.\\n\\n----\\n\\nUpdate 4, 7/30/15 11:48pm\\n\\nI have completely moved out. The leasing people, who I talked with for an hour, were *exceedingly* unhelpful. If I ever want to be able to legally move out of there I have to have him co-sign a \"roommate separation agreement\" and he. will. not. sign. it.\\n\\nThey tell me that I wouldn\\'t even be able to be eligible to get my deposit back until both of us move out. I asked what that meant if he stayed there for 5 years and the woman shrugged at me. They say also that anything that is problematic with the apartment while she\\'s there is my responsibility too because my name is on the lease. \"You\\'re telling me that my roommate brings an uninvited guest and her dog against my wishes, I report it, and I\\'ll get in trouble for having an unauthorized pet?\"\\n\\n\"Your name is on the lease.\" the woman said and stared blankly.\\n\\nLater, in an unfortunate fit of rage while loading/packing, her stupid dog walked past me in the hallway while the front door was open because I was carrying things. I yelled, \"GET OUT!\" at it. \\n\\nLooking worried it ran outside and she chased it. I closed the door and locked it. Not like she has a key. Anyway he threatened to call the cops. I told him go ahead, but he backed down. After talking with my parents they suggested, \"Oh why don\\'t you talk to dear family friend, the attorney who specializes in real estate whose husband is a realtor and they are our neighbors and you practically were an older brother to their daughter?\"\\n\\n*facepalm because I completely forgot about that wonderful woman* \"Yes, please, dad. Would you please call her and ask if it\\'s ok for me to get her advice?\"\\n\\nHe sent off a voicemail and an email. Hopefully I will get in touch tomorrow. I am exhausted and going to bed.\\n\\n----\\n\\n**FINAL UPDATE** 8/3/15  6:53pm PST\\n\\nOn Friday I wrote a formal letter and sent it to the leasing office and CCed the roommate stating I had moved out, new person had moved in with dog, I wish to give notice, he wont let me off lease, etc. I also stated I would be pursuing small claims court action. I did.  Then I went to the local small claims court and submitted California SC-100 form for 3 months rent, my deposit, and an extra $1000 for potential pet damages against the roommate. 3 months is because court dates can take a while and if I wasn\\'t allowed off the lease I would have to be compensated. I had no expectation of getting this money; what I wanted was to be able to walk away free and clear. That was the alternative I planned to present to him.\\n\\nI received a text on Friday evening from the roommate that I had been released from the lease. I know he had not received the paperwork yet, so this was likely a response to the text I sent him that said, \"hey I need you to pay me $4200\" as required by law (I have to ask for it before taking legal action). The leasing company made it clear I still had to give 30 days notice so today being the 3rd I had to visit the office and pay my half of the $1875 rent so I could walk away. I was prepared for that outcome.\\n\\nI asked for my copy of the release form he signed and then inquired about the rent I had to pay. Apparently he added his girlfriend and her dog to the lease. She is on the lease. Their names are on the lease. \"Wait,\" I said, \"does this mean I don\\'t have to pay for August?\"\\n\\nIn true bureaucratic form they answered, \"Your name is not on the lease.\"\\n\\nI blinked and stared. \"I\\'m... free?\"\\n\\n\"Your name is not on the lease.\"\\n\\n\"Can I get that in writing?\" I inquired, starting to feel a twinge of hope.\\n\\n\"That\\'s what this release form is. It was signed on the 31st. You claim to have moved out. Your name is not on the lease.\"\\n\\n\"Would you like my keys?\" I asked\\n\\n\"We can take them or you can give them to your old roommate.\"\\n\\n\"Thanks I\\'d like to never see him again.

I was going to quit, but we are so understaffed that the GM wanted me to stay, until a replacement was found. The deal (which was made by the GM), was that I would need to stay working there, until a replacement was found, and in return, I would get a third day off and a raise of 35 cents. For four weeks straight I got the third day off, but not the fifth/last week I'd work there. That fifth week was a day that we would have an inspection done by the owner of the restaurant and a couple other people. Without telling me that I would need to work an extra day that week, the GM puts me to work for five days. This wouldn't have been a problem, if it was the first time this happened. When I saw the schedule on Monday, it was still being reworked, but I did see my name and the times I would work. I thought that he was working on it, so I didn't really think much of it. The next day I worked, I noticed that he hadn't changed a single thing from what I had seen the day before. I thought that it was odd, that he would do this, since it was a deal that he made the conditions for. The whole time I worked that day, I couldn't stop thinking about the reason he could have gone back on the deal, without telling me. I assumed it was because of the Inspection we were having. This eased my mind until I remembered that I had done a deal with him before, that he went back on, after the fourth week. This knowledge made me think hard of the last time. I started to think of the pattern that these two shared. Four weeks of him going through with the deal, not getting it the fifth week, getting it again on the sixth week, and then never getting it again after that. This realization made me believe that it was going to happen again. I didn't want it to, so after a day of talking about it with my family, I decided that I would quit at the end of the week. The next time I worked, I told every co-worker that I was going to leave at the end of the week and why I was doing it. (I wanted to have a nice goodbye between me and the other workers that I enjoyed working with.) I also asked them to do me the favor of not telling the GM I was leaving till my last day. I did this since I didn't believe that the GM deserved a heads up about me quitting, since he went back on the deal. I did this until my last day. On the morning of my last day, I came to work with a type of cake that I would bring whenever it was someone's last day of work. When he saw this cake, he knew something was up. He asks me about the cake, and I respond by saying that it was my last day. He gets surprised and wants to know why. I explain my reasonings and end it with saying that I didn't want to work for someone who would keep going back on deals after the fourth week. He protested by saying that he thought that I would understand. I did understand, but that doesn't mean I have to like it. \\n\\n\\nThis small section is about me actually being an asshole. Throughout my last day working there, any time the GM would mention him being able to make deals with people and being able to follow through, I would go very out of my way to mention that he could not follow through after the fourth week. It didn't matter if he was talking with an employee, customer, or one of his friends, I would mention this.\\n\\n\\ntl:dr   GM makes a deal with me so I don't quit, then goes back on said deal one month later. \\n\\n\\nEdit: I just realized how much I typed.\", 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA For Quitting My Job Over a Botched Deal?', 'url': 'http://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3f9scw/aita_for_quitting_my_job_over_a_botched_deal/'}, {'author': 'creppsweq', 'author_created_utc': 1393778830, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'author_fullname': 't2_fip29', 'created_utc': 1438347417, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'edited': 1438409153, 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3fa9u3/planning_to_cheat_with_a_girl/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '3fa9u3', 'is_self': True, 'link_flair_css_class': '', 'link_flair_text': '/r/relationships', 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 29, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3fa9u3/planning_to_cheat_with_a_girl/', 'retrieved_on': 1440577556, 'score': 17, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': \"So, me and my friends tend to chill every week or so.

I invited her at to come over at 9:30, knowing everyone else would be late and come like an hour later but I did not think or want to do anything sexual with this girl. Well we were talking about it and as a joke I said, 'what would your boyfriend say if I slipped my tongue in you LOL' she took it seriously and said sexually , 'I would tell him nothing happened'. Then I was confused and did not know whether she should still come that early. She proceeded to say that we cant do nothing major like blowies or anything. (At this point I was hiding how my emotions were exploding within me) I felt said we would feel guilty but she said again ' nothing is going to happen though ;)'.

She left huge messes all over the house (dirty sports equipment, clothing) and would render shared spaces unusable for hours (using the living room to Skype her family, taking 2 hours in the bathroom when everybody else was getting ready for work). She also had it out for me. If I so much as left a dish in the sink, she would call my boyfriend to tattle on me. She would get mad at me for not washing the dishes she used to cook herself a 4-course meal and thought I wasn\\'t \"doing my share\". I cooked my own food and washed my own dishes...\\n\\nEventually, I told Anna to chill out and stop complaining. She was the only person who ever complained, out of four people sharing the house. She did not take kindly to this and decided that she and John were moving out ASAP.\\n\\nShe and John moved out while my boyfriend and I were on vacation. I cleaned the entire house before we left, and when I got back the house was a disaster. There was garbage all over the floor, molasses spills on the hardwood and they had taken all of our toilet paper, so I couldn\\'t even pee at home after a 15 hour plane ride at 1am. They had also left dirty dishes PILED in the sink and the garbage can overflowing onto the floor.\\n\\nMy boyfriend was off at work and didn\\'t have to clean the mess (I did). He also decided that John could continue to use our garage and shed as a storage space (even though they don\\'t pay rent and have their own garage, but that\\'s none of my business). John and Anna kept one of our house keys so they could access the house where the garage key is kept.\\n\\nAnna is over at the house at *least* every two weeks, and she only comes when the house is empty.

I got home and the driveway was blocked by him, so I had to park on a different street than where I live. \\n\\nI asked my boyfriend to either take the key back, or tell Anna that she can only come over when I am home. I said I knew it was his house, but I lived there too and I felt uncomfortable with Anna having unlimited access to my possessions and pet because she had proved that she doesn\\'t respect the space.

Prior to these three months, I was really close friends with this kid (lets name him George). I\\'d hangout with him everyday and play video games and all that. We were both really lonely and craving female companionship. \\n\\nI began to go out with Samantha around January. When I started going out with her, I began to spend a significant less amount of time with George, and more time with Samantha. Obviously, since him and I were really close friends, this kind of bothered him. \\n\\nI felt pretty guilty, and Samantha didn\\'t have too many friends outside of me, so I introduced them. Luckily, they slowly became friends. After a week or two, George expressed to me that he is atracted to Samantha and \"would cuddle the shit out of her\". This made me feel incredebly uncomfortable. He\\'s a really socially awkward kid and is really sensitive so I decided to just be chill about it with him for now. I did talk to Samantha about it though, saying that I was ok with them being friends, but regarding what he recently said, I\\'d like it if some boundaries were sent in place. And she agreed and asked for some specific examples. I said something along the lines of like; I love the fact you\\'re making new friends and all, and I\\'m cool with you hanging out with him, but would you mind not skyping him? Thats kind of our special thing that I want to keep. And she agreed. \\n\\nA few more weeks pass and it seems as though these boundaries I thought were set in place were completely ignored. You see, all three of us are artists, I\\'m am the least skilled out of all of us, but it is certainly something that is incredibly important to me. I believe it was a long weekend or spring break or something, but I saw a drawing on both they\\'re Facebook feeds. I knew the art style was hers, and the caption on his was \"I made this with my friend the other day.\" And I thought for a while, and maybe it was totally irrational, but I was rather hurt. And it was because the only way they could have done this was through skyping and dropbox. I confronted her and she confirmed it. I was really hurt that she disregarded these boundaries she agreed to, and did something with someone else that I had been looking forward to for a long time (drawing something with her). \\n\\nI got rather mad and hurt, but instead of lashing out at both of them, I confronted George. Samantha doesn\\'t like this kind of attention, so I tried as much as I could to leave her out of it. I sent some things to him that admittedly were really harsh and mean and I shouldn\\'t have said these things. We get into a fight for a while, then Samantha calls me and tells me that George told her everything. I felt this was a pretty shitty thing to do as well\\n\\nA few days pass and I see yet another drawing on their facebooks. Again, I was really mad and hurt, but instead of lashing out again, I just kept it in and apologized to both of them for earlier. George says that he doesn\\'t want to be friends anymore. I understand that. I said some awful things and he has the right to not accept my apology. Samantha accepts my apology and we move on. \\n\\nGeorge later says \"You\\'re being 1) A terrible boy friend 2) An over protective jerk (Something I really feared) 3) you\\'re hurting my best friend (Samantha) who I care about most right now. This really hurt considering that shes my girlfriend and all. But I understand where hes coming from. He doesn\\'t have too many friends, and he does care about her. We were both hurting her though. \\n\\nA few weeks past and I find out that George has been telling Samantha about things I said and did that I explicitly requested remain us (George and I). I reviewed the things that were said and about 70% of it was either untrue or exaggerated. I explain everything to Samantha, and apologize and tell her that I was in a bad place and angry and not thinking and I take it back. She says she needs a day to think about things.\\n\\nShe calls me late afternoon two days later and says that we\\'re not right for each other. And that we need to break up. \\n\\nA day later. I see more drawings up on facebook.\\n\\nA week later. Shes away from her computer and they begin to send letters back and forth.

I always put gas in it.\\n\\n**me**: that's like the bare minimum you can do when you borrow someones car, you shouldn't be bragging about that.\\n\\n**him**: i'm not bragging, I'm just saying it's not like I'm not putting gas in it\\n\\n**me**: well I guess it's annoying how you are always asking to use it, why don't you just fix your car?\\n\\n**him**: i'm going to fix it on thursday\\n\\n**me**: mom always gets mad when she knows I let you borrow it.\\n\\n**him**: That's so dumb, that makes me so mad at both of you! I will always let you borrow whatever you need without any question!\\n\\n**me**: I've never borrowed anything from you before\\n\\n**him**: That's not the point!\\n\\nThen we got into an argument about how he always takes the key off the keyring and how it's bending itself out of shape and how I don't want it to fall off the ring because it's my only copy of the key, he denied ever taking it off the ring, just a really childish argument all around. \\n\\nI didn't do a very good job of defending my argument, I never brought up the money aspect, I hardly talked about how my car is never there when I want it. \\n\\nAnother thing is how angry he gets when he drives. Like, I don't expect that he would get into a car crash, but I've been in the car with him driving when he decided to yell at a man for parking in a handicapped spot when he wasn't handicapped. It happened right up the street from our house, and my car is pretty distinctive, so it would be pretty easy to find/key.\\n\\nAm I the asshole for getting upset when my brother borrows my car?\", 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA for not letting my brother use my car?', 'url': 'http://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3fsobm/aita_for_not_letting_my_brother_use_my_car/'}, {'author': 'Viperbunny', 'author_created_utc': 1329699576, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'author_fullname': 't2_6yuaf', 'created_utc': 1438726672, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'edited': 1438735709, 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3fswxi/aita_for_insisting_my_husband_tell_me_what_was/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '3fswxi', 'is_self': True, 'link_flair_css_class': 'not', 'link_flair_text': 'not the asshole', 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 17, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3fswxi/aita_for_insisting_my_husband_tell_me_what_was/', 'retrieved_on': 1440568737, 'score': 17, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': \"I am at my parents' house this week visiting and he had to return to work.

When I asked why he said forget about it and we would talk when we had more time. I have aniexty disorder and he knows that if he tells me he needs to talk to me and then doesn't tell me what is going on I get very nervous. I asked to him to please tell me. I was worried something happened between him and his mom (she can be difficult to deal with at times), or something had happened to his 91 year old grandfather, or something happened to the new car. There were so many different things it could be and I was worried about it. He tells me to forget it. I tell hi. He can't just tell me we need to talk and the refuse to talk. He even went as far as hanging up on me. I called him back and begged him to please tell me. I was getting angry at this point. I told him I would be panicked all day if he didn't let me know what was happening.\\n\\nHe gets really angry at me. He tells me he got his blood work back and has to go on Lipitor. He tells me I am too pushy and am an asshole for pushing him when he was going through such a difficult time. I told him I was sorry, but he was the one who wanted to talk and he couldn't tell me there was a problem and then just leave me hanging. I told him I love him and I just want to support him and we can figure out how to handle this. He gets mad and says he doesn't want to talk now because I had been too pushy and he couldn't deal with me right then.\\n\\nI did send him a text apologizing, but I told him I was very worried and I just needed to know what was going on. We have already started eating better because I recently was told I have celiac and can't eat wheat or gluten and we have been eating things like quinoa and more vegetables in place of certain foods. I will help him through whatever he has to do to get healthier. I don't want to make this about me, I was just very concerned for him.

He refuses to talk and then yells at me and accuses me of being too pushy for needed to know what was going on.\\n\\nEdit: We talked. He was just nervous and scared and didn't handed it well. I think I could have handled it a bit better because I did get pushy when I got nervous and scared.

While we were getting coffee, he asked why I wasn\\'t coming to his party, which came as a total shock.\\n\\nBasically, he asked a mutual friend to organize things, since she\\'s got more know how of the club scene. He gave her a list of people to invite and let her take things from there, and she left me out. Now, he assured me it was probably just a mistake on her part and filled me in on details, and I offered to drive him (and arriving with the birthday boy made me way more comfortable...) I didn\\'t let her know I was coming, figuring if it was a mistake, she\\'d know, and if it wasn\\'t, I wanted to gauge her reaction. \\n\\nWe arrived and she was very \"surprised\", not particularly happy to see me, standoffish, during conversation she would not even look at me... I felt out of place, thinking I shouldn\\'t have come (to my best friend\\'s party!). Dinner was fine, because everyone else was acting normal with me, but I came back from the bathroom and she was making fun of my fav eye makeup look. Someone else came to my defense, but I was getting more and more pissed off. \\n\\nMe and the girl are formerly very close friends, but our group had problems at the beginning of the summer, and things were really tense for awhile. I thought we had resolved everything, or at least forgotten about stuff, but she was acting like I\\'m mad at her and being very cold in general. She kept bringing up the fact that I haven\\'t invited her out the whole summer, but she spent half of it overseas and has been back for two weeks, 9 days of which I have been out of town. I told her as much, but she pointed it out at least twice more that night. I wasn\\'t intentionally avoiding her -- and am I not justified in feeling like it\\'s a two way street? I have shut her down once when she and a few others were trying to chill -- she was trying to crash our band meeting, which is reallllly a bad time, since we\\'re trying to put together an ep before summer ends. The band was all in agreement that it was a lousy time, and unanimously asked her to dip. \\n\\nAnyway, we pre-gamed before the club, and I was trying to shake off the bad vibes + was feeling stupid for being mad. We were having a thumb war tournament and she dug her nails into my thumb and wouldn\\'t let go after clearly winning and clearly hurting me. I was so pissed, I got up immediately and went to dance. \\n\\nWe wound up leaving before 2, because the birthday boy wasn\\'t feeling it, and starting to get sick. This was at a gay club, and I was the only member of the party who was straight. As we were leaving, she complained about how there were too many straight girls there that night. She took him home, but we\\'d originally planned to sleep at her place. I figured that was off, and I forgot my contact case and solution, plus I didn\\'t feel welcome, so I bugged out. I mean, I didn\\'t even go back inside her place, I was so salty. I don\\'t really know what happened after. \\n\\nSo here\\'s my problem: any one of these things is not really a big deal. the thing is, I\\'m getting mad about it all, and every time she rolls her eyes it just makes me so fucking pissy. I don\\'t want to be the one who starts shit in the group, and I don\\'t want to stir the pot after we just made up on the whole, but I brought it up to my best friend, who told me I was just being a stereotypical angry aries worry wart. And then I started thinking my own actions could be conveyed as just as bitchy (showing up without telling her I was coming since she planned the whole thing, walking off in a huff like a bad loser, coming to a gay club as a straight girl, skipping out on the end of the night).

First off there\\'s the main girl we\\'ll call her M (I will also refer to M and \"her\") then there is the guy we\\'ll call him D(I will also refer to D as \"him\"), there is another girl that I had a thing with we\\'ll call her H, my ex is also apart of this story we\\'ll call her S, and of course me. We are all in high school although D is a grade higher than me and M. M and I have been friends for about 6 months now and I have grown to like her a lot. We have similar personalities and have gone through a lot of the same shit in life, making it very easy for her and I to sympathize with each other on most everything.\\n\\nIn the beginning of our friendship I was talking to and pursuing H, I had no idea that M might like me at all. Eventually the thing with H fell through. After it fell through I had a conversation with M, where I learned that M liked me before she knew I had a thing with H, she then told me that she no longer liked me and had moved on. After this I started dating S and M started to have a thing with D, I was happy in my relationship and I was happy for her.\\n\\nLong story short I broke up with S and decided that I was done with relationships for awhile. I was still happy for M and D they never officially started dating but they were happy together and what did I care. As school ended and summer began M and I were talking and Skyping a lot, during these conversations we grew very close. I learned that her best friend and her were having a fight and weren\\'t really talking. So in away I became her person she talk to. \\n\\nIn the middle of summer M and D hadn\\'t gone on a signal date or seen each other, the last time they had seen each other was the last day of school. M had told me that she wasn\\'t really interested in dating D and only wanted to be good friends with D but didn\\'t want to push D away so she said nothing to him about being just friends. So at this point I thought that they weren\\'t dating and that she didn\\'t like him. One day we were texting and she mentioned that she had just had an amazing day with D at a local theme park, I guess this \"date\" had changed her feelings for him. I started to ask questions about her day and what it was like. What I found out is that M and D aren\\'t officially \"dating\" but they have a \"thing\" whatever that means. \\n\\nThe next day we were Skyping and I told her that I liked her and that I have feelings for her, M told me that she likes me as well but she also likes D at the same time, she said that she knows that its a bad thing to feel and that it wasn\\'t fair to either me or D. We continue our conversation like nothing happened. In other Skype conversations I tried to bring up the whole topic of her liking me and D, but most of the time she would avoid the question or talk about something else. The one time that I did get her to talk about it was when she listed the pros and cons of both me and D. Both me and D had about the same Pros (She says that we\\'re very similar, I don\\'t know him to well), my one con was that I wasn\\'t in her friend group and D\\'s one con was that he was a year older than her. Neither of these cons being that bad.\\n\\nMoving this long story up to just a few days ago. While I was texting her she seemed kinda out of it and wasn\\'t really in the conversation, if that makes any sense. Anyways I asked her what was on her mind and she replied with a wall of text. This wall of text basically said that M was feeling pathetic because she can\\'t face anything coming towards her (I\\'m assuming she meant the situation with me and D) M also said that I really likes D but he tries to fix everything and be her shrink but all she wants him to do is to listen but she doesn\\'t think he capable of just listening. She went on and said \"And you, oh you are just, basically perfect, and that\\'s actually really annoying because I want to just like D and be done with it but I can\\'t because when I talk to you it reminds me of what he isn\\'t. And I hate that. I really don\\'t like it. But it\\'s there. And I don\\'t know what to do with it. And I feel awful for feeling that, because it\\'s not fair to either of you.\" Honestly, I don\\'t know what to take from this part of the text, but now you\\'re caught up to present day, My question is am I the asshole For wanting her to be with me and just go up to her and ask her to be my girlfriend and not be with D ?  Feed back and questions are welcome.\\n\\nTLDR: She likes him and me and has told me this, I like her ( I have told her this) and want her to be with me and not him.\\n', 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA For wanting her to be with me and not him', 'url': 'http://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3gki7j/aita_for_wanting_her_to_be_with_me_and_not_him/'}, {'author': 'flignir', 'author_created_utc': 1337108497, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': 'Asshole #1', 'author_fullname': 't2_7q73v', 'created_utc': 1439292855, 'domain': 'youtube.com', 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3gkxtq/meta_another_amitheasshole_segment_on_painkiller/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '3gkxtq', 'is_self': False, 'link_flair_css_class': '', 'link_flair_text': 'META', 'media': {'oembed': {'author_name': 'WoodysGamertag', 'author_url': 'https://www.youtube.com/user/WoodysGamertag', 'description': 'Dollar Shave Club: http://dollarshaveclub.com/PKA PKA Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/pka PKA on iTunes: http://bit.ly/PKAOniTunes WoodyCraft / Minecraft IP: woodycraft.net Join Team Gamertag ► http://bit.ly/TeamGamertag Scuf: http://scufgaming.com Coupon \"WOODY\" http://bit.ly/ScufReview Kontrol Freeks 10% off: http://bit.ly/KFDiscount WoodysGamertag T-Shirts: http://bit.ly/WoodysShirts Connect With Me: Facebook: http://facebook.com/woodysgamertag Twitter: http://twitter.com/woodysgamertag Google Plus: http://bit.ly/WoodyGoogle Tumblr: http://woodysgamertag.tumblr.com', 'height': 338, 'html': '&lt;iframe class=\"embedly-embed\" src=\"//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FDJgmV9vYqbQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed%26start%3D4813&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Ffeature%3Dplayer_detailpage%26v%3DDJgmV9vYqbQ&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FDJgmV9vYqbQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=2aa3c4d5f3de4f5b9120b660ad850dc9&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;', 'provider_name': 'YouTube', 'provider_url': 'https://www.youtube.com/', 'thumbnail_height': 360, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DJgmV9vYqbQ/hqdefault.jpg', 'thumbnail_width': 480, 'title': \"PKA 242 w/Dollar Shave Club CEO -

(Later found out that when she changed it was the same time she got a new dog - which brought her to the two-pet cap at her boyfriends house (because she brought her other dog with her there))\\n\\nI reluctantly agreed- I was having a difficult time at the place I was staying (invited 'friend' to live in a spare room and she became hostile and refused to do anything to support herself or the household- different AITA I guess). Anyway I wanted ou bad because I didn't want to kick this chick and her baby out so I figured I would just leave. \\n\\nWe get out here and everything is worse than i remember her telling me (house is in worse shape, animals are VERY badly behaved etc) but we get to work. It ended up being four cats (not sure how my math got skewed but I'm telling it as I remember it) because she had already taken one to her place before we got there, plus the stupid dog. \\n\\nIn the first few months, one of the cats ran off through a hole I the house that we did not know existed. We still have not found the cat but we did cover up the hole. Gradually she begins taking animals- first one of the other cats, because it did nothing but howl and howl constantly because none of the damn cats were fixed. She paid to get that cat and one other cat fixed. The last cat (GGC) had already been fixed. My mom and I converse occasionally about the possibility of me keeping the last two cats. She got her new place and after like two months she finally took the dog after us Begging and begging because this dog was a pain in the ass and peed and pooped all over and whined constantly really loudly. I fully agree to take one of the cats but leave GGC up in the air. \\n\\nIn between this stuff we rescue a dog and two kittens off the street. We wanted to keep them but ended up finding them good homes instead because it was too much for us to handle. \\n\\nI continue to ask when mom plans to take GGC, and she keeps putting it off, and I say that she needs to go to the vet. An appointment is not made until I casually suggest calling HER mom about it instead (who was supposed to pay for the vet bills if my mom took the cat in). Cheap shot, but this cat needed treatment and I absolutely could not do it myself. \\n\\nAt the appointment it is discovered that this cat had FIV which is not transmittable to humans but is to other cats and she must be keep away from other cats. At this point we have our two original cats and the one of my mother's that we are keeping. My mother has three dogs and three cats (one newish kitten that SHE rescued and decided to keep) along with a bunch of rodents. It is already well known that my mom is an animal hoarder. \\n\\nWe discuss who takes the cat and it gets a bit heated. We have a three bedroom house (the one she gave of, free of charge) and a toddler and a baby now on the way. She has a two bedroom house, a barn, a lot of land, and it's just her and her husband. This cat should not be kept around other cats. My mom says she has far too many animals to be able to take her and nowhere to keep her. Currently this cat is in our third room, which we would love to be able to use since we will be needing the extra space. My mom then bought a kitten from petsmart, at which point I flipped out, we had a huge fight, and I asked her why EXACTLY she felt she could get another kitten but not take this cat if she did indeed think she had too many animals. She flat out told me she couldn't answer that. She also says she never remembers saying she would take ANY of the cats back, and she also remembers the dog being part of the original deal- all of which conflicts with what I thought was the original deal.\\n\\nI caved and said fuck it, I'll take the cat but you still have to do all the vet stuff. We have not talked about it since, except for me jokingly saying we would trade GGC for the kitten, who LOVES my daughter.\\n\\nAM I THE ASSHOLE???\", 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': \"AITA For not wanting to keep my great grandma's cat?\", 'url': 'http://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3gmz8r/aita_for_not_wanting_to_keep_my_great_grandmas_cat/'}, {'author': 'Zdrastvutye', 'author_created_utc': 1433806608, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'author_fullname': 't2_nzjqd', 'created_utc': 1439334595, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3gnkre/aita_for_reporting_two_colleagues_of_mine_to_my/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '3gnkre', 'is_self': True, 'link_flair_css_class': 'not', 'link_flair_text': 'not the asshole', 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 6, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3gnkre/aita_for_reporting_two_colleagues_of_mine_to_my/', 'retrieved_on': 1440554250, 'score': 12, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': \"I was working a 4-9 shift in the shop I work in, along with three other members of staff, a team leader (TL) and a manager. I was working the tills, which in my shop is a long desk with three tills on it. The space behind it isn't particularly big, about 1.2m (4ft) wide at a guess. This gets used for returned items, as a holding area for big/bulky/heavy stuff customers want (saves them carrying it round) and so on. It is my job at the end of the day to ensure this area is as clear as possible (particularly for health and safety reasons). \\n\\n**Person 1**\\n\\nI'll call him N. He was working the main floor section and started at the same time as I did. Now we have an internal phone system where each section has its own phone, along with the duty manager. I came on, gave both him and me time to get ourselves going, and then gave his phone a call to let him know he had stock to go back out. He told me he'd get it as soon as he'd done some pricing, which is fair enough. This was about 4.30pm. \\n\\nSkip forward to 5.30pm and I hadn't even seen N around. I gave him another call and reminded him about the stock. He told me he'd be down 'shortly'. I also did the same at 6pm as it was pretty much dead by this point but I couldn't go off my till to do them as I was by myself. \\n\\n8.30 comes and still this stock was stuck behind my till. Now at this point G was sat at the end of my till doing paperwork, and I asked him if he'd seen N. Now G isn't a team leader or manager, he is the same rank as I am. But when HE called N to do the job I'd been asking him for almost all of the evening, magically he appeared within 20s and did it all. I was sorely annoyed that such a simple job had taken so long, but also that N seemed to think G was more worthy of being listened to. \\n\\n**Person 2** \\n\\n  I'll call this person Y. Y was a member of our stock team, but also works a till. If I need extra till staff then I do a tannoy asking for someone to come, and in this case I believed that Y was my first call (you shout ordinary staff first, then a team leader if necessary/no-one else is available, then a manager). This happened late on in my shift, at around 8.15 when we got a small rush of people which left me a little overwhelmed. \\n\\n  A little earlier, Y had come down and was sat at the end of the desk on the computer which we have, doing something. He'd told me he was 'doing lock-up' and that he was 'supposed to have finished but [manager] told me I could stay'. \\n\\nThis queue built up, and rather than mucking about with a tannoy for till help I thought to ask Y as I knew he could work the till. He could quite clearly see I was in need of the help, but claimed he 'couldn't' go on the till because he was supposed to be finished. \\n\\n Now my logic is that if a staff member is on the shop floor, it is a reasonable expectation that they are actually actively working. But what particularly angered me was that this whole thing happened infront of customers, and it served to make me look (or at least feel) pretty bad when a staff member in uniform was there and not actually helping. \\n\\nSo, who was the asshole in these two situations?

This is just a well-known fact in my family.  Pretty much everything is about her and her feelings and god forbid you do something to offend her sensibilities (One time she told me I didn\\'t love her because I forgot to put the toilet lid down after peeing- not the seat, the actual lid).  Anyway it caused a lot of trouble for me emotionally while I was growing up, but I got over it and she\\'s \"manageable\" now and we have a decent relationship.\\n\\nOn to my plants.  I don\\'t have children or pets, and I don\\'t have many hobbies.  My one thing, the one thing in the world I am good at and people come to me for advice on is growing succulents and air plants (for those who don\\'t know what an air plant is, look them up, they\\'re awesome).  These plants are my babies, I had them on my desk and in my garden while I pushed through an incredibly emotional period in my life (crap job, crap town).  While I can\\'t say that they provided any emotional support, I can say that nurturing them and watching them respond to my care helped me feel an incredible sense of zen.  \\n\\nI finally got a job in a place I\\'d been interested in moving to, about five hours away.  I had to move an entire apartment on a budget, so I asked my mom (who lives about an hour from my old apartment) if she\\'d take care of them for me.  She said yes, which was much appreciated and is a huge favor.  It\\'s really no small task, I had about six or seven succulents and about thirty air plants.  Still, I drove them up to her place and she found places in the garden for the succulents and places in the house for the air plants.\\n\\nShe by no means has a black thumb- she has many succulents herself and even has two air plants of her own she managed to keep alive for over a year now.  Still, she made me swear that I wouldn\\'t be mad at her if some of my plants died.  I put aside five of the air plants and told her that these were my special plants and I would appreciate it if she could take extra special care of them.  I also told her about one of my succulents which is a rare crested variety and a prized possession.  She seemed to be paying attention.  I assured her there were NO SPECIAL WATERING REQUIREMENTS FOR ANY OF MY PLANTS.  In fact, she even has written instructions on the best method for watering all air plants, put together by me.  It\\'s super easy.  I told her to water my air plants when she did hers and same for the succulents.\\n\\nMost of my air plants are in handcrafted terrariums.  She was worried that she wouldn\\'t be able to remember which plant went in which terrarium, so I just told her to take them all out and leave them on a towel by a window to get partial sun.  I told her I would put them all back when I had a chance to get them from her.\\n\\nApparently, that was too complicated for her, because a week later she tells me she\\'s going to try to sell some, with my blessing.  I am uncomfortable, but tell her OK as long as it\\'s not the five I\\'ve set aside.  Then I get another blow when she tells me she sold a piece for $10.  I told her that the materials alone costed closer to $40, but she said she just wanted to make space.  I know she\\'s weird about clutter, so I let it slide.\\n\\nI didn\\'t hear anything from her for about two months on this subject.  Then, last weekend, I asked for pictures of some of my plants because I missed them (and I knew they were getting a bit more sun, so I was excited to see how well they were growing!).  She doesn’t send the pics for like three days.  When she does, I am extremely disappointed.  It is clear she has not watered a single plant in two months.  My rare crested succulent is fried to a crisp, which is incredibly heartbreaking (as it is kind of irreplaceable), and the other plants I’ve nurtured for over two years are dead and dying.\\n\\nShe tells me she’s going to water the air plants the next day.  I know for a fact that this is the first time she’s watered them in two months, goaded by my request for photos (she even asked me if my requesting photos “was a test”).  Of course, she reports back that a lot of them are dead.  Not only the ones that I was a little less attached to, but the five I selected because I had an emotional attachment to them.  One of those five is called tillandsia tectorum, and was easily a $30 specimen.\\n\\nNeedless to say I am beside myself right now.  I can’t even bring myself to talk to her, and I usually talk to her every day.  It’s not like she’s busy, she doesn’t have a job and me and my brother have been out of the house for years.  I honestly have no clue what she does on a daily basis.\\n\\nSo, what do you think, Reddit? AITA for asking such a big favor of her? Should I have expected it? AITA for being mad at her?  How can I talk about this with her?  No matter how I tell her I’m upset, all she’ll do is focus on the fact she was doing me a huge favor and how I should be grateful.  At this point in my life I don’t know if that’s her being narcissistic as usual, or me being selfish and rude.

A school bus pulled up and a group of very rowdy students and adults from a local recreation center got off and began to play in the field.  One of the teachers brought a student over to the picnic tables.  Instead of sitting the child at any of the 11 unoccupied picnic tables in the immediate area, she sat him at the one that I was using.  Keep in mind, I had been the only one there.  All of the other tables were available.\\n\\n\"I\\'d actually prefer to eat privately,\" I said to the teacher.\\n\\n\"No, you\\'re fine,\" was her reply.  \\n\\nSince she obviously wasn\\'t going to move the child to any of the vacant picnic tables, I packed up my lunch.

I agreed with them, but I persisted that they chose to use the one table where someone was quietly minding his own business.  This is like going into a movie theater where only one person is sitting in the middle of the theater and deciding to take the seat smack dab next to them.  Or getting on a bus where there are loads of open seats but deciding to take the seat right next to someone.

Basically, I'm living with a roommate for the next few months although I'd much rather live alone. If you don't want to know the details, just skip the next part:\\n\\n&gt; Six years ago, I moved into this flat with two roommates and back then, I loved it. We got to know each other quite well, and after a while one of my roomies became my girlfriend. The other roommate moved to a different city but also kept her old room, so she could come over from time to time to visit her old friends. Basically, it was just me and my gf most of the time and I got used to that. I didn't want to share my personal space with anyone else anymore.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; But A few months ago, my gf confessed that she had an affair, I broke up and kicked her out. So then her room was empty and I couldn't afford the rent alone. Finding a new (cheap) place to live is a nightmare in my city.

However the situation, however muted has been a powder keg of an issue that could blow up if somebody comes across just the wrong way. \\n\\nAnyway;\\n\\nThe first and largest issue starts off with my friends; a married couple, and a mutual friend of ours. We\\'ll call the married couple X and Y, the mutual friend We\\'ll call Z.\\n\\nAnyways, Z and I had gotten into this table to game that was relatively new, and found a local game store that was going to start running events for it, enter X and Y. Over the following year we all become rather great friends and a wonderful group to just chill with if not just to play a game. \\n\\nEventually it became open knowledge Z was in an \\'Open\\' relationship with his SO, and that he was actively looking.\\nX had confronted Z and asked him \"as a friend\" (note this for later) not to involve Y in his search. a reasonable request.\\n\\nFast forward to New Years. This is that part that I prefaced about where I don\\'t know (or really want to know) the whole story. all I know is that Z overstepped his bounds, violating X\\'s request. So much so that it caused significant issue between X and Y (They\\'re stable, but I\\'m to believe they\\'ve not come to terms yet).\\n\\nthere was a period of time when they closed up shop for several months, and didn\\'t invite or really speak to anybody while they sorted stuff out between themselves. I\\'m unsure how much they\\'ve confronted Z about it, but I don\\'t know if they have due to the personal conflict. Perhaps they swept it under the rug to save face. either way, eventually things got back to \\'normal\\'\\n\\nfast forward to a new expansion that had been out for the game we all played for a bit. X had more or less found a rather potent combo that would later become a strong competitive play. Z, who at this point became the organizer for tournaments and such for said game at the LGS (Local Game Store).\\n\\nSeeing the combo executed in full strength made Z upset, feeling that it was unbalanced and wanted to have input brought in from the game\\'s higher-ups. Z had went to X, and asked him \"As a friend\" to not play that combo during the next tournament, as he cannot outright tell somebody not to play anything, unless rules say otherwise. This made X pretty upset, and ran it anyway. Lo and behold, Z has issue with it. but like my wonderful friends to, instead of talking it out, they continue to just walk away from the issue and let the pot boil.\\n\\nfast forward about 6-7 months or so, and we\\'re doing the initial stuff for store championships at a different LGS. Z was getting flustered, as X happened to have a gameplay strategy that was able to overtake Z\\'s. (Z isn\\'t running this event, as a side note) Losing sucks, and people get hot headed and flustered, so this wasn\\'t unusual. X however took it a little to personally, when Z was making statements on him building something to directly counter him. \\n\\nThis was the straw that broke the camel\\'s back, however. Most of us (X, Y, Myself, and a separate other concerned friend who opted to play mediator for Z) decided we needed to organize an intervention for Z\\'s attitude, as from one side of the argument, he was having an attitude problem with alot of us. (He had been having job issues, and other personal conflicts, and stress buildups.) We decided to get with Z first and get more info. It was miscommunicated on what X was going to do, but what winds up happening was X renounces his friendship with Z, in an attempt to just remove ill-will from X\\'s life just by removing him as a friend. \\n\\nThat\\'s pretty much the bulk of it, Eventually Y does the same, as she tries to talk with Z and he seems to not want to listen to anything. \\n\\nI\\'m still friends with both parties, and while X &amp; Y seem OK now, Z still has issues. He feels like he can\\'t show up at the LGS sometimes in fear that X is there. (Which to me, is just fucking stupid. but that\\'s just because i think the whole thing is stupid, minus the first issue which i believe is the core of the problem).\\n\\nI think it seems pretty clear who the asshole is. but i feel like I may still be missing several important details, and I can\\'t ask Z about said details as I don\\'t want to stir the shitstorm back up, and I\\'m on my word that I wouldn\\'t talk to anybody else about it.\\n\\n(Posting this from an alt, even so as not to be stumbled across.)\\n\\nI\\'m unsure how to proceed, but these issues have basically killed the playgroup, and the game for our LGS, and I can\\'t seem to organize any decent hangout time, as X &amp; Y got out of the game, and are doing other things. Z still runs the game at said LGS, but I have to keep in a decent topic otherwise he\\'ll get a near anxiety attack just thinking about the bullshit issues. Alot of this will probably read extremely trivial and one sided, and from an outside source, it basically is. there\\'s some things I\\'ve left out as they\\'re complicated to explain, and aren\\'t exactly of importance\\n\\nI just wanna get my friends back to normal but I don\\'t think it\\'ll happen especially since none of them apparently know how to talk or listen to each other.\\n\\nWho\\'s the asshole here? X/Y for not being forthcoming with their feelings? Z for completely burning X and Y\\'s trust? Or perhaps I missed a cue in stopping the whole thing?

I’ve always made it a point, in my adult life, to be certain about the things that I do so I don’t have to rely on someone else's opinion for anything, but every so often I realize that I have been doing or not doing something or other that should have been obvious to me and I was completely overlooking it. I suspect I might not be the only one this happens to. To the point.\\n\\nI’m 48, divorced, hispanic, male, not ugly (I don’t think) and with a decent job. I almost finished a 2 year associates in Graphic Design, hated school, didn’t click with the artistic industry and “fell” into a career in desktop support. Got into some debt, around 3,000 dollars worth, was feeling it with the rent and making 35 a year and decided to move in with my mother “just for a little while” until I could pay off the debt, fix my credit and save up for a down payment on a condo. That was almost ten years ago.\\n\\nMy mother lives in Miami. She is 83. She’s alone here. There is some family back in our home country in the caribbean. She’s not sick. She can fend for herself very well. She is accident prone and forgetful but not too bad. With her social security check she was struggling to keep a 3/2 family home in a gated community with association fees, home insurance and taxes. She’s also still driving a 90 Mustang which is in pretty good shape but still needs repairs every so often. I moved in to the second half of the house and took 2 of the bedrooms with the adjacent bathroom. I use one cabinet in the kitchen, a drawer in the fridge and another in the freezer. For that and my share of electric and water I give her 450 a month. Rent around here is currently at 750 to 800 for a studio. I buy my own groceries, cook my meals and clean up after myself, do my laundry and keep my side of the house clean and organized. Stuff breaks and we split the cost of repairs if I cannot fix it myself. I drive her and get her stuff when and if she needs me to, which is not very often. I smoke in my bedroom, but she also smokes in the living room (yes, nasty, I know). She puts up with me turning on the A/C to 75 at night and I put up with her banging pots and pans in the kitchen at 11 pm. We used to slug it out almost very day at first but by now we hardly ever even disagree on things. I feel we get along marvelously. \\n\\nHere is the asshole part. I smoke weed on fridays and saturdays after she’s gone to bed. I keep less than a quarter ounce stashed safely away, use filters, incense and cigarettes to mask the smell, count the numbers of hits I take and make sure to put everything away once I’m done, mostly to keep it hidden. \\n\\nIn my adult life, I’ve always thought of myself as a very honest person. I know that there cannot be such a thing as 100 precent perfect honesty, there is always something you’re going to have to keep to yourself. But I try to be. And it just dawned on me recently that I’m not being honest with my mother by doing this. But is that a big deal? This is why I’m here now. I’m not sure that I have an objective outlook on this situation. I was raised to believe that weed is evil and immoral so there are a lot of guilty feelings in me regarding the issue. In my mind I’m doing something “naughty” and “wicked”. But is it? Not so much the smoking part. That I’m convinced it ’s not evil. It’s the smoking in my mother’s house part. But, I pay some rent. So it’s not like I’m a total guest. Or is it? Does carrying my weight give me some moral or ethical credits in this situation?\\n\\nI know she probably would disapprove very strongly. She is, after all, the one who taught us that weed is evil and sinful. But I also suspect that she suspects I do it and lets it be because in the end it doesn’t harm anyone and she is benefiting from my being there with her. Which brings me to the nest thing that I’m not certain about. Am I “abusing” or “manipulating” the situation? Am I taking advantage of her wanting me to be there as leverage so I can get away with smoking weed without her intervening? I figure she suspects, but in recent years, with all the legalization going on, her stance has somewhat softened up and she rather not say anything because I don’t over do it, I do it in the safety of my bedroom late at night and I’m not a total deadbeat son. \\n\\nI don’t know if any of this is relevant to my question, but I’ll add it all the same. I am, like I said, 48 and divorced. I have no plans anytime in my future to look for a mate. It’s just been a train wreck so far and I’m done feeling hurt. I haven’t dated since 97, haven’t talked to anyone on the webs since 05. I know that eventually mom will pass away and I’ll be pretty much by my lonesome self here in Miami. My brother lives in NY and he’s too busy raising a family to pay attention to me. But that’s something I’m getting ready for. I’ve always felt better off alone anyways. I’ve become very comfortable living here with mom, despite the limited living space and the smell of burning onions. My salary has only gone up by around a dollar in the 10 years I’ve lived here. I haven’t made an effort to upgrade my career. I like what I’ve been doing; fixing macs around town, going home whenever I get my work done. It’s cushy. Maybe I’ve wasted all this time by not learning new things or exploring some other venues. Right now I don’t feel I would be this comfortable living alone with this salary. But I’m finally working on that; getting more certifications and widening my scope of experience. I tell myself that I stay here partly to keep my mother company besides helping her out financially and otherwise. That could be bullshit. Then again, the thought of me moving out and then her getting seriously hurt because I wasn’t there or someone breaking in or something else happening because I wasn’t around gives me serious pause. We got broken into in the middle of the day around 3 years ago. We live in an area that is close to a high crime neighborhood. She’s had people confront her about stupid shit at the grocery store. So it’s not a paradise around here.\\n\\nThat’s it. Thank you for reading and don’t hesitate to burn me. I’m a grown-ass man.

I have been living peacefully on the first floor for about two months until recently a single mother with three bad ass kids around the ages of six moved into the apartment directly above me. For approximately a week, the kids sound like they are intentionally trying to annoy the hell out of me by stomping around like apes.

I have tried talking to the mother and explain to her how to control her kids, but that just seem to piss her off.

Little does she know I have a 1000W 5.1 surround sound system that I have not put to good use since the move to these apartments. A day later, I cranked up the music about midday, it made the water in my glass vibrate, so i'm sure she enjoyed the booming bass just as much as I. That went on for half an hour or so before I judged she had enough. For the rest of  the day I was able to read my Game of Thrones in silence, but to my disbelief, the next morning was hell. I could literally hear the mother tell her children to play football inside because it was too hot outside. Really bitch? I had to take it to the next level. The blasting of my music lasted for hours at a time during the day, I even gave her a taste of it around five in the morning. I can tell you she did not love that by the banging on my door about 20 minutes later. I told her I like to get pumped before my morning runs. She cursed and purposely stomped back upstairs to her zoo that she called home. Later that day I continued my music festival in my living room for about 2 more hours.

I told them what Jenna had told me and they thought it was weird and also thought that I should just come anyway.   My friends are also Jenna's friends as we are in the same friend circle that is popular among highschoolers.

We\\'ve no moved in to together and mostly awesome. We\\'ve been playing a lot of Rocket League, Factorio and Minecraft. These are all games that require some level of coordination and agreeing decisions. \\n\\n**BUT**, over the summer my friend got into a long-distance relationship with a girl he\\'s know for quite some time. I have no problem with them talking to eachother like any new couple would. That is, with lots of \"I love you\"s etc. I\\'ll just put on a headset and watch some YouTube video or listen to music so they can have a bit of privacy. \\n\\nMy problem is that he will interrupt ANY conversation, no matter the situation, and start talking to her. The other day we were playing Rocket League with two of my longer-term friends, and he, to me, didn\\'t look or sound bored of it despite not really knowing the two others. Then suddenly his girlfriend calls him on skype in the middle of the match. He stops moving, tabs out, disconnects from TeamSpeak and starts talking to her.\\n\\nIn Rocket League he\\'ll also stop driving, look at and reply to a snap, and then start driving again. \\n\\nHe\\'s done this a number of times during different game sessions, and it\\'s starting to piss me off. \\n\\nYesterday we played Factorio. During a downtime in the production, I whipped out my electric guitar and started playing. I did not plug it in, and there was nothing to do in-game. He got visibly and audibly irritated at that, and normally he doesn\\'t have anything against me playing. I put it away after just a couple of picture, because he obviously didn\\'t like me playing at that time. Not even 30  minutes later his girlfriend calls and he starts talking to her exclusively, with me being second in line.\\n\\nAm I the asshole for not just accepting him being in love, which I feel like I do already? Should I just suck it up because \"that\\'s just how it is\"?\\n\\n**EDIT:**\\n\\nSomething else that\\'s been pissing me off about it is that when they talk they\\'ll have two conversations going at the same time. One over snapchat/steam, and one on skype. Sometimes it\\'s painstakingly obvious that something is \"going on\", that they don\\'t want me to hear/see. He\\'ll angle the phone away from me when recieving a snap, go to the bathroom and then emerge two minutes later. And then do it again five minutes later. I just feel like that is something that should be reserved for when I\\'m not around. Like every single tuesday and every other weekend.

Now my girlfriend and I argue quite a lot and a few months back during an argument she made a personal attack on me and I in turn made a personal attack on her. My girlfriend then turned around and slapped me twice; saying her actions were justified because of what I said. I did not slap her back and simply told her to get out of my room. \\n\\nNow recently we had another argument which was much worse and in this argument I realised where this was going and repeatedly told my girlfriend to leave my room so we could cool down. She refused. \\n\\nEvery single time I tried to make her leave she would scream \\'Don\\'t touch me!\\' Don\\'t touch me!!\\' \\n\\nSo I went into my bed, under the covers and stopped replying to her in an attempt to cool down, she did not like the fact that I wasn\\'t arguing back with her and thus she in turn poured bottle of water all over my bed covers so that the water seeped through. I then got pissed and tried to snatch the bottle of water away from her to pour it on her and in the process of the struggle she pulled the bottle away really fast and hit her thumb against a wall which turns out ended up breaking her thumb (we didn\\'t know this at the time). \\n\\nAfter this I repeatedly asked her to leave and she refused.\\n\\nI then locked myself in the bathroom and told her I was going to call security; it was at that moment she began to scream saying \\'Don\\'t fucking call security!\\' whilst trying to force open the bathroom door, I didn\\'t want to create drama in my uni halls in front of my room mates (who I didn\\'t really know well) so I held off from calling security (bad decision I know).  \\n\\nOnce it seemed she calmed down I came out the bathroom and the arguing continued. Once again after we verbally insulted each other my girlfriend then slapped me again, at the point I was beginning to lose it but I didn\\'t slap her back. I tried to restrain her and in the process she began trying choke me, I then threw her into the bed to get her away from me.\\n\\nShe got back up and tried to push me again but was unsuccessful. Fast forwarding after more arguing we finally calmed down slightly and there was a silent pause, I then kneeled down to put my charger into a socket and out of no where my girlfriend just pushed me hard and I got knocked into a chair. \\n\\nAt this point. I fucking lose it. \\n\\nI get up, I grab my girlfriend and push her so hard that she goes flying backwards at least 3-4 yards and smashes her back into my door. BANG. \\n\\nAll of sudden she lets off a shriek of pain. Real fucking loud. \\n\\nRemember my neighbors who I mentioned earlier that I don\\'t really know? They hear the screaming and at least 4 guys show up outside my door hearing her screaming \\'You pushed me! You pushed me!\\'. \\n\\nThey in turn say \"Don\\'t worry we\\'re outside, if he\\'s treating you badly we\\'re here and we\\'ve already called security!.\" She then tells these guys who are outside my door to get ALL of her friends that live upstairs with her, within 3 minutes I have at least 20 people outside of my door thinking I\\'ve just beat my girlfriend up. \\n\\nSecurity arrive and ask me to open the door; I do so and immediately 3 security guards come inside and begin asking what\\'s happened. My girlfriend makes up a story about how she fell despite the fact that she just told the guys outside something entirely different. \\n\\nAs if this couldn\\'t get any worse about 5 minutes later I receive another knock at the door ordering me to open the door. It\\'s the police. \\n\\nOne of the students had called police and upon opening the door these two massive officers walk in. One immediately asks me to leave the room and come outside with him; I do so and as I walk into the corridor I see the looks of all these people I that had once liked me look at me with disgust; no one says anything to me. \\n\\nI\\'m questioned and let go and according to my girlfriend the police had asked her if she wanted to press charges; she declined.\\n\\nI walked back and I saw everyone from my floor, everyone from her floor, all our mutual friends as well as her close friends from back home who were visiting outside my room once again giving me the most disgusted look thinking I had just beaten her up. \\n\\nNeedless to say I lost all my friends that day and no one cared to even ask me about my side of the story. \\n\\nAt university I now have no friends, and will have to live off campus by myself which means making new friends will be incredibly difficult, it\\'s not helped by the fact that I\\'m really introverted. I\\'m also terrified of the prospect of even going out to freshers week as there is only one club at my university and I won\\'t have anyone to go with and anyone that I do bump into from last year will make it really awkward. \\n\\nThis literally keeps me up at night, so tell me, was I an ass hole? \\n\\nEdit* - I\\'ve realised that me and my girlfriend can no longer be together.\\n\\nEdit edit* - I just realised PKA is being recorded tonight, perhaps this will be featured on the show.

Upon hearing this news my wife wanted to see me have one. Because we have what I thought at the time was a healthy sex life, I obliged.

She says that she should be the one that gives me the best orgasms not some toy. I don't disagree with this assessment which is why I think she needs to step up her game in the bedroom. Her answer on the other hand is to simply deny me sex if she suspects that I have been masturbating. I think all of this is fucking ridiculous because I just started using sex toys recently while she has been using them for years. She even uses a vibrator for her clitoris while we are actually having sex. I don't mind this at all. I think that any job which is important is a job which requires tools. As far as I'm concerned, sexual health and satisfaction are important and therefore require the use of specialized tools such as dildos, vibrators, porn, whips, etc. I don't think she has any right to try to discourage me from behaving the same way she does.\\n\\nThe only reason why I think I could even possibly be the asshole in this situation is because early in our marriage when I found out she was using sex toys for masturbating I felt some trepidation. She told me that despite the size difference between my penis and her dildos ( I'm smaller ) sex was still great. She also explained to me that she needed to have her clitoris stimulated during intercourse in order to orgasm consistently. I was able to exercise the anxiety I felt about toys over the course of a few months once we started using vibrators during sex.

I\\'m making this because I\\'m not really that sure if he is one or not, but I will be making this from my point of view]\\n\\nContext: My Theology teacher (male, approx 35) was supposed to go to a doctors appointment, but the sub was unable to fill in, so he probably became pissed that day. I am a male senior in highschool probably pissed him off.\\n\\nIn Theology class, my teacher (I\\'ll call him Mr. Johnson) asked the class who has their homework from his desk. I said that I did, since I was close to him, I decided to try to hand it to him. Unfortunately, the distance between me and him was about a yard, so I tossed it onto his desk. He caught it and then ripped the paper and saying, \"You don\\'t throw things to me.\" in a stern voice and then threw the shreds in the recycling bin.\\n\\nI decided that I would pick up what\\'s left of my homework after class. About 5 minutes after Mr. Johnson ripped up my homework, another teacher (I\\'ll call her Ms. Robertson) came into class asking for the recycling bin, so I was unable to take back my homework, tape it back together, and attempt to try to return it in. Because Ms. Robertson \"just happened\" to come into the class asking for the recycling bin, I\\'m very positive that Mr. Johnson did this, since he already knew that Ms. Robertson will come in for the bin.\\n\\nLater on in class, one of my classmates (I\\'ll call him Sean) turned around and told me that two years ago, Mr. Johnson burned his notes in class. It turns out that, at the time, Mr. Johnson told Sean to not take notes, so Mr. Johnson put Sean\\'s notes into a bowl and lit them on fire. After hearing this, Mr. Johnson\\'s behavior is not that abnormal to my situation.\\n\\nCoincidentally, the topic of Plato\\'s interpretation of \\'what is evil?\\' came. Accoriding to Plato, there is not such thing as not good and that evil is just not accepting good. In a way, Mr. Johnson tearing my paper can be seen as him teaching me a lesson on respect/his untold class rules. After school, I asked him if I could make up the homework. He said not to worry about it and that he will accept it. Basically, this entire situation was an extremely harsh \\'slap on the wrist\\' scare tactic punishment from my teacher.\\n\\nSo, what I\\'m trying to ask is, is Mr. Johnson an asshole for over reacting, or do I deserve what happened because of my disrepect?\\n\\nTL;DR: Teacher, probably pissed because sub no-showed, ripped up my homework because I tossed it to him when he was a couple of inches away. He saw that as disrepect, and decided to teach me a lesson about respect, but he ended up taking the homework in the end.', 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': \"AITA for ripping a student's homework.\", 'url': 'http://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3hwick/aita_for_ripping_a_students_homework/'}, {'author': 'MikebibbyoverMJ', 'author_created_utc': 1438358061, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'author_fullname': 't2_p7oq3', 'created_utc': 1440202197, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'edited': 1440202932, 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3hwx0a/aita_for_leaving_the_stall_door_open_while_i_took/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '3hwx0a', 'is_self': True, 'link_flair_css_class': 'not', 'link_flair_text': 'not the asshole', 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 30, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3hwx0a/aita_for_leaving_the_stall_door_open_while_i_took/', 'retrieved_on': 1440532661, 'score': 25, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': \"While at a Minor League baseball game walking back to my seat in the 7th inning, I stopped at the bathroom there was only one urinal open and I didn't want to piss next to two other guys.

I\\'m not sure if I\\'m the asshole because I\\'m too judgmental, or because I\\'m enabling someone who\\'s done something I consider despicable, or neither.  I\\'ll try to TL;DR each paragraph.   \\n\\nTl;DR 1: **As an individual, I am pro life.**  I know it\\'s a pipe dream, but it\\'s my personal hope that not a single other abortion ever happens again in human history (and that includes the equally ridiculous underlying hope that there are no more rapes or cases of incest that cause unwanted pregnancy, etc. etc.).  Just to complicate matters, if I were in government, I would have to vote pro-choice, because I cannot possibly convince myself that the government should claim the right to force a person to go through the medical and emotional ordeal of carrying an unwanted child, under any circumstance. \\n\\nTL:DR 2: **One of my very best friends had a completely elective abortion, and I have only been supportive, and only expressed concern for the possible emotional impact on her.**  She was living with the guy for years when this happened.  She was finished school and employed. As was he. There were no medical problems.  There were no relationship problems.  There was no sexual assault.  She married him a year later, and now they \"want kids\".  She just said the time wasn\\'t right.  I assume all this info is true, because she was never showing, and didn\\'t need to tell me anything about the pregnancy but told me the story anyway.  \\n\\nTL:DR 3: **I am constantly silently ashamed of the fact that I have never breathed a word of disapproval to her over this.**  I really don\\'t know what I think I should do, but I know that if I had a friend and I saw him stab a stranger to death in the street and he somehow was found innocent at trial, I would ostracize him.  I would no longer count him as a friend or associate with him if I could help it.  I would have to do something to say that that shit isn\\'t cool, and I have no interest in associating with someone capable of that.  In my mind, abortion without extreme extenuating circumstances is an order of magnitude more heinous act; the victim is infinitely more innocent and defenseless, and the killer is infinitely more directly responsible for that victim\\'s protection.

When I was a sophomore and Jacob was a junior, we started to become best friends. We were both middle of the pack in the social hierachy, like we were friends with everyone but we never really had someone to hangout with everyday until we became friends. We are both Mormon and love sports, and we are both average looking guys. Except, I dont know, Jacob, he\\'s kinda goofy looking to be honest. He has really curly hair and braces, and coming from his best friend I\\'d have to say that if I were a girl I would call him cute at best.\\n\\nWe both talk to lots of girls, but we never really end up doing much with them in form of a relationship or anything like that. We never really got that close with girls.\\n\\nFast forward 2 years. I\\'m getting ready for my senior year, and Jacob is about to leave for his 2 year church mission in a few months. Right after Jacob graduated, his family moved down to a city 30 minutes from my house. (Before that I also lived 30 minutes away. He lived next to the school and I lived pretty far out, now he just lives south of me instead of north.) In the beginning of the summer, we hung out a good amount. Then Jacob made new friends at his church branch in the new city. The Mormons at our old school were the weird, not very attractive girls, very strict kinda religious nuts. Jacob said that at his new church branch everyone was much cooler, and the girls are a lot prettier. He said there was this one called Alyssa, and I\\'ll be honest with you, he sent me a pic of her and she is a solid 9. Of course, I was ecstatic that my best bro is hanging out with such a beautiful girl.\\n\\nFast forward to August, the end of the summer. Me and Jacob have only hung out once for only a few hours. Apparently things have gotten pretty serious with Alyssa. They talk everyday, they hangout almost every day, they go on dates, etc. Remember this is my boy Jacob, one of the goofiest kids I\\'ve ever known and things are getting serious with a very pretty girl. Me and my other good friends try to get Jacob to hang out with us all the time. Usually he can\\'t because he already has plans with Alyssa. At first it was understandable, but after a while it got to be kind of a joke. It seemed like he clearly did not want to hang with his bros. We used to be the biggest proponents of \"bros before hoes\". We vowed this summer to go on a mancave binge, playing our favorite videogame NBA2K, our favorite movies, etc... But it never happened. He was always hanging with Alyssa. When me and my friends would complain to him, he would say, \"No guys, this girl is different. This is for real.\" And that would make me really upset because he is leaving for a mission in October! Why does he wanna hangout so much with this girl when he\\'s gonna leave soon for two years to possibly across the world and have very limmited contact with people at home?\\nSo Jacob mentioned he was going to a high school football game in the new city, and he mentioned that he was going with Alyssa\\'s family. (Alyssa is currently out of town visiting a friend, but her family is still here.) So I guess things are serious enough to where he hangs out with her family when she isn\\'t even around. So then I texted Jacob this\\n\\nBefore you read it, just so you know, Madi is a girl I\\'ve always had the biggest crush on.\\n\\nhttp://imgur.com/7VPlfe2\\n\\nhttp://imgur.com/9jv0vDO\\n\\nhttp://imgur.com/cpdFrYb\\n\\nhttp://imgur.com/WkkKe1S\\n\\nI\\'ve always been the nice guy. I\\'m never this rude to anyone, especially never my best friend. But I\\'m tired of it. Always ignoring me and always hanging out with his new girl, I\\'ve been fed up. I wanna get the chance to hang with Jacob while I can, before he leaves for two years.\\nSo Reddit, that\\'s my story. Am I the asshole?

We live together, and are in the same year of the same program in university. We spend most of our time together, and I genuinely love her to death.\\n\\nShe frequently asks me to do favors for her, many times a day. She asks me to drive her places (appointments, classes, the gym, friends' houses); get her things from the store; fetch her drinks or make her food; proofread applications, reports, emails, and assignments; and accompany her while she runs errands. She does reciprocate the favor if I ask her for something similar, but I don't regularly ask her for anything, and there is a huge imbalance.\\n\\nShe asks me for so many favors throughout the day that I feel like I spend more time doing things for her than I do for myself. The part about accompanying her on errands is the one that drives me the craziest. Most of the activities only require one person, and I feel like my involvement is a waste of my time since she is perfectly capable of doing these things by herself.\\n\\nAlso, we have both spent the entire summer working full time, and begin school again in less than a week. We moved to a new place on Monday, and had only 10 precious days before the start of school (next week on Wednesday). It is now Thursday, and so far we have spent most of our time doing things with very little relevance to the house.\\n\\nFor instance, on Tuesday, we went shopping for nearly 4 hours so she could buy a raincoat (legitimate need, since it has been pouring here lately and she was scheduled to go kayaking on Wednesday). This resulted in her buying 5 jackets at 3 different stores, 4 of which were returned today after she chose the one she liked the most. On both occasions (the purchase and the return trip) I accompanied her.\\n\\nThis afternoon (the same day as the return trip) she asked me to come with her to the pharmacy to get a prescription filled. While we waited the 45 minutes for it to be filled, we went shopping in the connected mall, where I watched her try on shoes. I wanted to look in the nearby bookstore, but my request was expressly denied and  we never made it there.\\n\\nHere is the conflict: I am frustrated and angry with my gf for causing me, in my opinion, to waste the little time I have before school starts. Our program is very intense and I will be doing 12 months straight with very few breaks. So, naturally, I wanted to take some time to relax and refresh before the shit storm starts to brew again. \\n\\nOur house is still a disaster. We already blew off a camping trip with our friends because we wanted to have enough time to get our shit together. Now though, I don't feel like we will have time to do anything besides organize the house, and I am getting stressed out and frustrated.\\n\\nAITA for being mad at my gf because I feel like she has wasted my time?\", 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA for thinking my gf is wasting my time?', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3jkv0z/aita_for_thinking_my_gf_is_wasting_my_time/'}, {'author': '[deleted]', 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'created_utc': 1441389432, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3jnb0w/for_completely_raging_at_my_friend_for_not/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '3jnb0w', 'is_self': True, 'link_flair_css_class': '', 'link_flair_text': 'no a--holes here', 'locked': False, 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 11, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3jnb0w/for_completely_raging_at_my_friend_for_not/', 'retrieved_on': 1450819155, 'score': 21, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': '[deleted]', 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'default', 'title': 'For completely raging at my friend for not breaking the law for me', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3jnb0w/for_completely_raging_at_my_friend_for_not/'}, {'author': 'Jordan_Welch', 'author_created_utc': 1401154458, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'author_fullname': 't2_gq8ug', 'created_utc': 1441402160, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3jo5hb/aita_for_caring_about_my_little_brothers_health/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '3jo5hb', 'is_self': True, 'link_flair_css_class': 'not', 'link_flair_text': 'not the a-hole', 'locked': False, 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 7, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3jo5hb/aita_for_caring_about_my_little_brothers_health/', 'retrieved_on': 1450818761, 'score': 8, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': \"My parents have raised two healthy children(myself included) prior to my brother who is now 6.

I went to the same college as my sister and it was a fairly small school where, if you never met someone before, you probably both know multiple other people.\\n\\nI had a recitation class and sat near two other guys, call them Ed and Tim. Ed and I ended up becoming good friends. Tim was an alright guy but I didn\\'t know him well. Ed knew him better than I since they were the same major. \\n\\nThe TA for this recitation was a female graduate student we\\'ll call Wendy. For various reasons we didn\\'t like her much and often joked in private about her being disgusting or a psychopath (in reality she was Ok, it was unfair exaggeration). Though Tim and Ed initiated it, they might not have thought Wendy was Ok.\\n\\nAfter this term was over I found out somehow that Tim had a crush on my sister, call her Rachel. For some reason this amused me and I came up with a plan. I told Ed and he helped. \\n\\nTim and I had communicated on AIM somewhat. After the term was over Wendy contacted me about something unrelated and I lied and said there was something wrong with my email, could you IM me. So she did and I got Wendy\\'s AIM screen name.\\n\\nEd got on AIM ostensibly to chat with various people, including Tim and I, but Ed purposely chose a screen name very similar to Tim\\'s (there was a natural way to do this, given Ed\\'s interests).\\n\\nThen I fabricated a message to Ed relating Rachel\\'s screen name and regarding some plans to go hiking somewhere, but \"mistakenly\" sent this message to Tim instead of Ed. And instead of my sister\\'s screen name it was Wendy\\'s, the TA we didn\\'t like. So from Tim\\'s perspective he learned Rachel\\'s screen name by accident from me, not knowing I knew anything about his liking Rachel.\\n\\nI never found out what (might have) happened and it was never mentioned again, but Tim seemed to be more reserved and inhibited around me after that, though it\\'s possible I\\'m imagining things. And I realize now that, if he initiated conversation with Wendy thinking it\\'s Rachel, he probably would have tried calling her \"Rachel\" early on and figured out it was Wendy before he said anything embarrassing. In any event, nothing ever happened between him and my sister. \\n\\nHonestly I had no problem with the idea he wanted to date Rachel, I\\'m not that protective of her or anything. But at the time I was entirely inexperienced with the notion of having feelings for a girl (yea I\\'m kind of weird like that) and saw Tim\\'s crush as a source of humor.\\n\\nOn the one hand I sort of feel like an asshole and have some regret about it, since my social grace was underdeveloped especially regarding relationships and I was motivated primarily by the idea of causing awkwardness between Tim and Wendy. On the other hand, I feel I can regard it as harmless fun since Ed was so enthusiastic about helping and Ed was more socially competent than me and was on good terms with Tim, before and after the incident.', 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA for playing a prank on a guy who had a crush on my sister?', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3jsvwo/aita_for_playing_a_prank_on_a_guy_who_had_a_crush/'}, {'author': 'sexyninjahobo', 'author_created_utc': 1399171755, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'author_fullname': 't2_gf2k0', 'created_utc': 1441498152, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3jsy6n/aita_for_leaving_inappropriate_farewell_note/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '3jsy6n', 'is_self': True, 'link_flair_css_class': 'ass', 'link_flair_text': 'asshole', 'locked': False, 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 13, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3jsy6n/aita_for_leaving_inappropriate_farewell_note/', 'retrieved_on': 1450816452, 'score': 19, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': 'Alright this one should be short and sweet for you guys!

So i put the car in neutral and put it in a little street where there would be assuredly no trafick however there were people nearby so i knew i would have to act fast. I pulled the second car up (my moms in this case) and began to work but naturally some things needed to be adjusted primarily car positioning for the cables. So i was there for about 5 minutes with the engine running before 2 different neighbors came out and started asking me what i was doing, talking about how late it was, and telling me how inconsiderate i was. I quickly but profusely apoligized and explained my circumstances but they werent having it. I got the car started after much micromanaging and complaining. So i set to launch the first car off then boom i bumped my car with my moms car. this was primarily due to all the stress i was put under by my neighbors. The damage was miniscule to none and obviously i would make sure if there was a problem it would get fixed.Without even getting out of the car to assess damage i pulled off to go park it. So that was fine and dealt with so i headed back for the other car and my neighbor says to me \"dont hit my car on your way in\" and that just really set me off.(despite my ever so shitty day i do take pride in my driving) I contained myself because i didnt want to make things worse and i left the neighborhood because there was no parking available.

Since then, I've been giving rides to a lot of people. I've been giving my friend rides to school since it started in mid August. Every now and then, he won't need a ride and usually tells me around 20 minutes in advance. Last Friday, I pulled up to his house and called him twice but got no answer. A minute later I send him a text telling him to hurry up because I'm waiting. Then I tell him I'm gonna leave in 4 minutes, because school started in 15 minutes and I had to go to McDonald's and get something to eat because I didn't have time to eat breakfast at home. Time went up and I sent a text that said I'm going and left. About a minute later, he calls me and asks me to come back. At this point, I'm already back on the road and to turn around I'd have to drive through another neighborhood and that would take up about another couple of minutes to get back to his house. I tell him I cant because I can't be late to school again ( I already had 3 tardies. If I get two more before the end of the semester, I'll get detention). He starts bitching at me and at school (I was late again) he's texting me about how shitty it was that I made him go to school with his dad. I tell him I tried to call and text him multiple times and I even told him that if he didn't come out within 4 minutes, I was leaving. In my opinion, if someone is giving you a ride, and they waited 5 minutes while also trying to contact that person multiple times without any response, then they have the right to leave when they said there were going to. Its not bothering either of us anymore, but it really pissed him off and I was kind of indifferent to it. I wouldn't have left if I was his only way of getting to school.

So I have a conflict I\\'m trying to resolve and need external opinions on who is the asshole here. Here is the backstory:\\n\\nSo the conflict begins with our downstairs PlayStation 3. One member of the household, I will call him *Bob*, notices something is keeping him from being able to login to the netflix app. We have the PS3 setup with multiple *local* accounts, and the only way for *Bob* to login to his netflix account is by being in his local account. One day he opens up the PS3 which auto logs into *my* local account, sees he is not able to login to netflix then sees that because the netflix login is showing my PSN e-mail I must somehow be trying to use their netflix without permission and am fucking up their netflix in general (that isn\\'t true of course. the netflix app login automatically shows the e-mail of the PSN account associated with the logged in *local* account regardless of whether that e-mail actually has access to netflix).\\n\\nSo the other person, let\\'s call her *Jillian*, finds out about this (she my father\\'s girlfriend) and misinterprets the situation as *Bob* does, gets angry, then sends me this text:\\n\\n&gt;Please do not create any account and put password in the Netflix/TV in the front..You have no business and should create an account to Netflix that *Bob\\'s* paying..I need to you delete your account in they front room tv...And don\\'t do that ever again..!.\\n\\nOk, so this text from my perspective is fucking disgusting. For one, she automatically assumes that I must be tampering with netflix and am therefore in the wrong. \"have no business\"...really, is that what you have to say? This is especially offensive because I am known for sticking to what I know is right at all times. I have never logged into netflix, that is just the PS3 showing my info because the wrong *local account* was logged into. Next, she wants me to delete my fucking *account*. Now the fix is easy (to change which local account auto logs in, or just switch the local account at startup), so we have no need for that. Also, I play games on the PS3. I use my local account for my PSN account, and I already have permission to play games on the PS3. Last, she tells me to \"never do that again.\" I didn\\'t do anything in the first place. So basically this text is loaded with a bunch of bullshit assumptions put in a really aggressive \"I didn\\'t think about anything fuck you\" kind of way. \\n\\nSo the next day I talk to *Bob*, we set it straight, I fix it, we\\'re good (*Bob* and I are always cool but he also sometimes assumes things about what I do, but doesn\\'t get angry about it just waits for someone to solve it). He tells me he\\'s noticed she gets extra pissy at the beginning of the month, and it makes me give her a little more credit, but I\\'m still not ok with what she said. At that time we do agree that he will talk to her, and that I shouldn\\'t talk to her. Well, being me, I wrongly broke that promise and still wanted to make sure *Jillian* and I were personally on the same level of understanding. So the next day I talk to *Jillian* just to resolve it between us personally. I tell her, look, you misinterpreted what happened, so can we prevent this from happening again in the future? Think about the possibilities of the situation and don\\'t just assume the worst *and* then go about and get loud and make assumptions about me in a text. Now I was very calm in this argument throughout, never trying to offend her, but then she EXPLODES on me and starts telling me how wrong I am, how much of a baby I am that I \"can\\'t take\" her at her worst, and literally throws EVERY insult that relates to my own insecurities which have nothing to do with the actual conversation. She says how \"you have the audacity to come here after a long day, when I haven\\'t thought about this at all today, to give me an **ULTIMATUM** not to text you? Well guess what, if you can\\'t handle me at my worst you sure don\\'t deserve me at my best, if you can\\'t then get the fuck out of this house\". And my response of course was that I just meant any overly assumptive texts like the one she sent me. Not once did I insult her or attempt to spark aggression. \\n\\nIt was the most ridiculous reaction I have ever seen in any argument I have ever been in. She says she showed the text to her daughter who said it was \"fine\" or some shit. Well guess what, for those who know of MBTI, both her and her daughter are ESFJs so of course you both are blind to what you\\'re actually saying. (I\\'m an INFP personally. I think thoroughly about everything and when I *know* someone is in the wrong I *know* it, but maybe my perspective here still is wrong). Also, remember *Bob* told me in our original conversation (before I approached *Jillian*) that it could be that it\\'s that time of the month for her/her period (and that he has noticed she gets in this mood at the beginning of the month), which makes it even harder for me to gauge this. Because while she\\'s known for going out of control, it\\'s still extra fucked up even for her. And when I showed the text to my dad even he said \"there\\'s nothing wrong with it, yeah that is something I would have said too\" (he\\'s an ISFJ so he also has similar thought patterns to *Jillian*). But my dad *was* there for the huge argument, and he took my side and was totally not ok with her outburst of insults and anger.\\n\\nSo this leads to her going on full panic loud aggressive mode and I\\'ve been avoiding her for days, she even texted me again saying that she broke up with my dad and it\\'s \"all because of me...congratulations!\" (but every time they \"break up\" they just get back together again for various reasons that are too much to get into right now).\\n \\nSo, am I the asshole here, or what? My personal conclusion is that while I made a couple *mistakes* in my handling of the situation, I wasn\\'t actually an asshole while she clearly was.

When I still lived in City A, friend/acquaintance from City A said he will have some business in City B this month and asked if he can stay over my place in City B (which at that time I didn't know what it looked like, I was just scheduled to move to City B). I told him, yes he can no problem, but I told him that I do not know what my new place in City B looks like yet. And he said he'll try to look for different places. So for me, it was nothing sure. But of course, I mentally prepared that he is going to come over or night.\\n\\nFast forward to now, a few weeks before said acquaintance comes over. I just moved into City B and trying to settle down. There is only a single bed in the new place and I did not think much about the visit. Said acquaintance never followed up (to confirm the visit) anyway/either. I brought it upon myself to reconfirm the plans and then bring up (just to be sure) that there isn't any couch or extra sleeping bag. And then said friend tells me that he has no sleeping bag to bring. By the sound of the messages that came after I told him, it seemed that he expected that I'd have an extra mattress / couch in my new residence, something that I never brought up with him.\\n\\nNow he's messaging me about his problems (not blaming me directly) of not having a sleeping bag. I feel a bit bad for him, but I feel that I'm not supposed to be the one to solve his problem. This is because of the fact that I'm already allowing him to stay over. Moreover, from the messages, I infer that he's expecting me to find a solution as he has not offered any whatsoever. I haven't replied yet to him as I feel I have nothing to say that will help him. I've asked my limited amount of (new) friends in the city if they have sleeping bags but they have none.

Sometimes it's not even late at night, but during the day; if it's loud enough and persistent enough so that I can't hear my own tv or music inside my apartment, or it wakes me up from a nap, am I the asshole for walking outside, approaching the person, and asking them to turn it down?\", 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': 'AITA for confronting my neighbors who play loud music in the parking lot?', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3kkphu/aita_for_confronting_my_neighbors_who_play_loud/'}, {'author': 'bingbonggonghongkong', 'author_created_utc': 1433638248, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_text': None, 'author_fullname': 't2_ny8b4', 'created_utc': 1442002936, 'domain': 'self.AmItheAsshole', 'full_link': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3kl3r1/aita_my_current_girlfriend_has_been_hanging_out/', 'gilded': 0, 'id': '3kl3r1', 'is_self': True, 'link_flair_css_class': 'not', 'link_flair_text': 'not the a-hole', 'locked': False, 'media_embed': {}, 'num_comments': 8, 'over_18': False, 'permalink': '/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/3kl3r1/aita_my_current_girlfriend_has_been_hanging_out/', 'retrieved_on': 1450802909, 'score': 9, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'selftext': \"My current girlfriend and I have been dating about year and a half, my ex girlfriend and I dated about 2 years ago, there was a 3-4 period between them.

Sometime in the past month (roughly early August) I had a few different people stay with me for various reasons, during which time I had more passengers than just myself, and in late August (at least two weeks later) my roommate discovered that somebody had opened my rear door too much and it hit his car, causing some paint to be chipped off (around 4mm in diameter).  I have no clue when or who did this but it likely was somebody that was visiting - it definitely wasn't me since I don't sit in the back but I will take responsibility for my guests.  He notices this and brings it up to me - he says he will go get an estimate on it, I apologize and ask how much he thinks it will be, he has no idea but I just throw out a number of $300 that I would be fine compensating.  He goes and gets a quote from his favorite body shop, they tell him they need to repaint the whole piece (rear fender) and reblend the paint on the entire side of the car, total cost $1,600.  He tells me this and am I shocked on how serious he is - I suppose we live different lives with different priorities, but I can't fathom spending such an insane amount of money to fix such a small paint chip.  However, it's his car and that's what he wants to do and I can certainly respect his intentions but feel this is just such an insane amount of money.  One morning he says he wants to take it to the shop the next day, then heads off to work and so do I, not saying much after.  I decide to send an email telling him that I'm trying to be reasonable and kind here, but $1,600 is just insane, our garage is not a showroom, we have people walk between our cars every day and the car isn't covered, something like this has a chance of happening.  I regret what possibly happened with my friends/family doing this and increased the amount of money I'm willing to pay to $500, but that's really as high as I'm going.  He then decides that insurance is probably the best way to go about this, so I send over my information but I'm not really sure comprehensive covers things like this...in any case I sent things over but haven't heard if it worked or not.\\n\\nLater that night he and his girlfriend come home (they both live here), my roommate walks right past and the girlfriend comes up to me and says what I'm doing is wrong, that I should have apologized at the beginning and offered my insurance information.  I state how I didn't know this happened (and neither did they) for several weeks, and even now I can't see the paint chip from five feet away.  Also the insurance was just brought up today and I sent over the info.\\n\\nNow we have an insanely toxic relationship in the house, nobody talks to anybody and this has just made things horrible - I went to a concert last night but couldn't enjoy it because I kept thinking about this whole thing...\\n\\nAITA?  Assuming the insurance route doesn't pan out, is it reasonable to expect me to dish out $1,600 due to something like this?  Or $500?  Or anything?  I've heard the full range from people, I'd like to crowdsource this thing to see what the universe thinks.  I'm also trying to dig down to the actual truth of the situation and (trying to) paint it as a black and white situation, but really can't.  I think the core of this to me is that I don't really care about minor blemishes on my car, having an immaculate car stresses me out so I'd rather have a few dings to relax about it - clearly my roommate sees things differently.  And if it were something else, like a shirt or tie or appliance or something (or if I wrecked the car for some reason) I would happily replace it, because they are entitled to own that thing and I would have 'taken it away' by breaking it.  But for something like this, where the car functionality was not affected and I STILL can't see the chip from a few feet away, it's just not an expenditure I can empathize with and $1,600 is a lot of money...\\n\\nSorry for the ramble - once again, AITA?\\n\\nEDIT: I spoke with my roommate over text today to try and clear things up, stating how I felt it was unreasonable to expect perfection to be maintained in such an environment.  Not to mention our other roommate (that is sadly caught in the middle of this) stated that if he caused this then he couldn't afford $1600, or even $500, and that he had casually spun his keys around or slung his backpack inches from this car on many occasions.  We had no idea that a $2k bill would come up from such a minor mistake.  My roommate didn't take that well, stating that somebody needs to make him whole with this and he will not pay for damage not caused by himself.  Not really sure where we're going with this now, insurance has been contacted but I'm not optimistic for the outcome...\", 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'AmItheAsshole', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2xhvq', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'title': \"One of my friends apparently dinged by roommate's car, I'm offering to pay but apparently not enough.
