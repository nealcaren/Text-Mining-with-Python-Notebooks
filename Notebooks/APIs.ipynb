There are fears of trou\\nble for anybody arrested in connec\\ntion with the lynching. It may be\\nthat any arrests may be kept secret\\nto prevent further outbreaks.\\nThe governor himself came in for\\nsevere criticism for his action in leav\\ning the capital to make a speech at\\nthe state encampment of Confeder\\nate veterans, before the news of\\nFrank\\'s lynching reached the city,\\nbut after it was known he had been\\nkidnaped from Milledgeville.

Their\\ninvestigations were started at once,\\nbut with no such energy as was man\\nifested today.\\nApparently the huge volume of ed\\nitorial excoriations of the affair tele\\ngraphed into Atlanta Tuesday night\\nproduced a decided impression. There\\nwas the naturally-to-be-expected re\\nsponse from many quarters that the\\nincident was no business of any out\\nsider, but the better class in official\\ncircles plainly was considerably mov\\ned by the unanimity of non-Georgian\\ncriticism.\\nFor all this there were many pre\\ndictions, even from persons who de\\nnounced the lynching, that the cul\\nprits never would be found.\\nNew York, Aug. 18.

Wash\\nington. *\\nA CHALLENGE TO STATESMANSHIP AND\\nIMMORTALITY\\nUp in Washington the other day, the United States\\nSenators from Mississippi, the Honorable James 0. East\\nland, was named to the sub-committee of the judiciary\\nappointed to consider anti-lynching bills presented to the\\nUnited States Senate. It will be the duty of this commit\\ntee to recommend and give is approval to anti-lynching\\nlegislation and to facilitate it\\'s consideration by that au\\ngust body.\\nNothing now weighs so heavily upon the conscience\\nand mind of the great masses of intelligent American\\npeople, of all races, north and south, as does the crime of\\nlynching\\nNothing now weighs so heavily in the scales by which\\nthe fittness of the United States to give ideological, cul\\ntural, and economic leadership to the rest of the nation\\nand people of the world is being judged, as does the crime\\nof lynching.\\nThe old idea, widely held in the south, that the law\\nlessness called lynching produced a certain kind of psycho\\nlogy among certain segments of its population and of the\\npopulation of the nation necessary to the development and\\nmaintenance of a certain way of life, can no longer be\\nmade to reconcile with the demands of progress in that\\nsection where the crime of lynching is most often com\\nmitted, and can no longer be made to reconcile with the\\nworld position of the nation.\\nNo matter how doggedly some of us cling to the\\ntradition and ideas out of which has come our sectionalism\\nthe time has now come when the nation is being judged as\\none whole, and world opinion will give no consideration to\\nsectionalism an dtradition.\\nSince the lynching massacre at Monroe, Georgia, and\\nindeed in all the years before that time, the regularly re\\ncurring lynchings leading up to the recent lynching trials\\nat Greenville, South Carolina, the verdicts which left the\\nnation looking so badly in the eyes of the world The law\\nlessness called lynching has been revealed as mainly a\\nproblem of the south where because of history and tradi\\ntion the crime has been given a certain sanction as being\\nnecessary to the maintenance of a way of life. ?\\nAttemps to convict those proven guilty of the crime\\nof lynching in the south, including those who confess to the\\ncrime, as was true in the Greenville, South Carolina case,\\npoint out almost beyond argument that the local com\\nmunities of this section are not yet able nor ready to pun\\nish lynchers and stop the crime and lawlessness called\\nlynching.\\nIn this period in the history of the United States and in\\nthe history of the world, the crime of lynching has become\\nthe great responsibility of the south and southerners;\\nand in this period the crime of lynching presents to the\\nsouth and southerners a period of the greatest opportuni\\nty. No other period in the nations history, by the simple\\nstep of openly and boldly attacking the crime of lynching\\nin the way most certain of its eradication, has offered to\\nthe south and southerners such a grand and great oppor- <\\ntunity to serve well the need of the south, while at the\\nsame time giving a greater service to democracy, the Na- j\\ntion and the World.\\nAs a southerner coming from a state where the tradi\\nEL MOROCO\\nFOR AMUSEMENT\\nPhone 4-9533\\nEDITORIALS\\n“Contrast in American Drama!”....\\ntion has long been recognized as having greater power and\\nforce than the law, and greater power and force than the\\ndemands of progress, the naming of Senator Eastland of\\'\\nMississippi to the subcommittee of the Judiciary in charge\\nof anti-lynching legislation offers little hope to those who\\nrecognized the need of such a law. Senator Eastland is ex\\npected everywhere to vote against any and all anti-lynch\\ning legislation. For him to vote for such a law even in the\\nlight of the very present and urgent need of the south, of\\nthe nation, of democracy and the world, would most sure\\nly bring down upon him the wrath of his political contem\\nporaries and those yet unable to see, or who refuse to heed\\nthe demands of a new and better world. For him to vote\\nfor such a bill however, would be the highest mark of states\\nmanship, and future citizens of Mississippi would add\\ngreatness to his name and generations yet unborn would\\narise to acclaim his name.\\ni We would not attempt to judge the political motive\\nbehind the naming of the senator to the sub-committee,\\nbut whatever the political motive, in the light of the pres\\nent needs of the south, of the nation, of the democracy,\\nand of the world the Senator also received a challenge to\\nstatesmanship and immortality.\\n5 PUBLIC TYPING 5|\\n! and * \\\\\\n!

       "   'ocr_eng': 'DAMNABLE WHITE WHELPS\\nSome of the white subscribers of (\\'nylon\\'s\\nWeekly living in Seattle felt thai its criti\\ncism of the cowardly whelps of the South,\\nwho lynch colored women. \\\\v;is too severe\\nHlitl became so incensed ;it what it said\\nthat they ordered their papers discontinued,\\nbut if they thought what we said Mas too\\nsevere, listen to what papers publislied by\\nwhite men and in the South at that, have\\nto say on the subject :\\n\"The (Auuusta. (ia.) Chronicle need\\nwast\" no words in expressing its horror of\\nof Ihe detestable and cowardly attack com\\nmitted by a party of LoAvndes County out\\nlaws, who. on Sunday afternoon last, tool<\\nfrom her home a woman —whose husband\\nhad been lynched the night before—handed\\nher to a tree and riddled her body with\\nbullets, because, forsooth, she had made un\\nwise remarks about the unlawful killing of\\nher husband.\\n\"All civilized people must stand aghast\\nat such <i ciime, and who does not is ;it\\nheart ;i criminal and ;i coward. So much,\\nthen, for this crime aganist the State of\\n(ieofui.\\'i. auainst socieiy. against humanity\\nmid against God.\\n\"The only thing worth discussing, in view\\nof ;ill the condemnation that similar crimes\\n;iii<l lynching in general have received from\\nthe right-thinking press and people of this\\nand ;ill other states —in which The Chronicle\\nIkis, heretofore, performed its full duty to\\nthe public, when some others failed —the\\nonly thing worth discussing now. we say, is\\n■what is the State of Georgia going to do\\nabout it .\\'\\n\"First of Jill, what is the governor of\\nGeorgia going to do:\\' For, of all the gover\\nnors who have served Georgia since the war\\n—or since lynching became a more or less.\\npopular pastime in this State—it will seem\\nto most people that he is more obligated,\\nif that be possible, to put down lynching\\nthan any of his predecessors.\\n\"For we cannot forget that Governor\\nDorsey was swept into the governor\\'s phair\\nby the lynching sentiment of the State. Not\\nmeaning, of course. Hint all the people who\\nvoted for him were lynchers in practice or\\nsentiment, but sa.ving and meaning that\\nAv\\'itlMMit this sentiment back of him, lie\\nmight still be solicitor-general of the Atlan\\nta circuit.\\n\"We cannot forget, nor can it bo denied,\\nthat his elevation to the governorship was\\n1 lit* direct and immediate result of the Leo\\nPrank lynching.\\n\"Nor can we get away from the fact,\\nthat, following this upheaval of lawless sen\\ntiment, lynching followed lynching in this\\nState—until Georgia soon Avon, and has held\\never since, the lynching record of the coun\\ntry.\\n\"And right here, it may be recalled that\\nthis is not the first time a Negro woman\\nhas been lynched in Georgia; another ease\\nof very recent time boinp; the cruel and\\ncowardly lynching of a Negro mother at. or\\nnear, Leary, Ga., for committing the horrible\\ncrime of trying to protect her son from an\\nunmerciful beating.\\n\"This and scores upon scores of other\\nlynehings that have occurred in this State\\nwithin recent years have e:ono absolutely\\nunpunished. A protest from the press, an\\nexpression of disapproval, here and there,\\nfrom the public, the perfunctory offering of\\nrewards for the lynchers—and there was an\\nend to it.\\n\"Not a single individual has been made\\nto pay the penalty for these crimes. Not a\\nserious effort has been made to apprehend\\nand punish the perpetrators of them.\\n\"Is it any wonder, then —assuming that\\nmen can be found who are so cowardly and\\ninhuman as to take part in such outrages-\"\\nthat lynchings continue to occur in Georgia?\\n\"Ts it to be expected that they will grow\\nfewer in number, or cease altogether, until\\nsomebody in Georgia does something to\\nbring to the gallows the brutes who partici\\npate in them?\\n\"Alas! that Georgia permitted herself to\\nbe set aflame a few years ago with the\\nlynching fever. Alas! that, at that time.\\nThe Chronicle was the only daily news\\npaper that dared to wage a crusade against\\nth.s unlawful sentiment, and to conduct a\\nsystematic expose of the motives and men\\ndacity of the men who were responsihle for\\nit : a service to its state for which reprisals\\nwere attempted against The Chronicle such\\nas have never been directed against any\\nnewspaper in Georgia,\\n\"Georgia then sowed the wind—and she\\nhas been reaping the whirlwind ever since.\\n\"Is it not, we ask, peculiarly up to Gov\\nernor Horsey to use every agency of his\\nhigh office — and if these he not enough, to\\nuse his tongue and pen and every power of\\nhis position—to put down lynching in\\nGeorgia; to help redeem his state from such\\nlawlessness as felt itself justified and glori\\nfied by his election .\\'\\n\"And Lowndes County! —one of the most\\nprosperous and progressive counties in the\\nstate: with as cultured and noble people in\\nit as are to be found anywhere on carth —\\nwhat will be its answer? What will its good\\npeople do to punish this crime of crimes\\nand. in a measure at leas!, wipe away this\\nstain:\\'\\n\"Or are such people outnumbered within\\nits borders.\\' .Must its law-officers give more\\nheed to the ignorant and lawless of its popu\\nlation than to those who have made Lown\\ndes county what it is.\\' —-one of the best\\ncounties in Georgia? It remains to be seen.\\n\"Hut. when we recall that Lowndes, with\\nits neighboring county of Brooks, has been\\nthe hotbed of anti-dip-vat sentiment; that\\nmany of its citizens deliberately dynamited\\ngovernment operated plants for eradicating\\nthe cattle tick in that county—and when we\\nsee, at this very time, that in the published\\nlist of deserters under the draft law, Lown\\ndes county easily leads all the rest, any forty\\nother counties, in fact with 211 deserters—\\nwe are compelled to confess that we fear for\\nthe power and influence of its better element\\nand, really, look for little or nothing to he\\ndone toward aprehending and punishing the\\ncowardly murderers of Mary Turner, the\\npoor black woman who made unwise re\\nmarks about the lynching of her husband:\\na new capital offence in Georgia, as Major\\nJoseph B. dimming so scathingly refers to\\nthis Lowndes county lynching\\' in a card,\\npublished in yesterday\\'s Chronicle, that\\nnobly voices the best sentiment of all real\\nGeorgians.\"\\n\"Stain on Democracy\"\\nSays the Charleston Gazette of Charles\\nton. W. Va.:\\n\"There are so many sidelights to our na\\ntional character that we turn automatically\\nhot and cold with self pride, but fortunately\\nthe thermometer registers high. We stood\\non the streets only a day ago and witnessed\\na remarkable spectacle in our own city\\nwhen 5,000 colored men and women, led by\\nhands, one a soldier organization from a\\neatonment, march through the city streets\\nin a patriotic demonstration. The thrill of\\npride that we all had in this race, which at\\nthe best is fighting under a great handicap,\\nwas dampened by a sense of shame we felt\\nwhen the papers carried a news item of an\\nother lynching outrage in the South where a\\nGRAND BENEFIT BALL\\nFOR\\nTHE SEATTLE BRANCH\\nTHE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION\\nFOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF\\nCOLORED PEOPLE\\nMONDAY EVENING, JUNE 10th\\nWASHINGTON HALL\\nFourteenth and Fir\\nMiss Lillian Smith\\'s Jazz Band\\nTickets 50 cents Elegant Punch\\nMrs. J. Vrooman, Chairman Committee\\nof Arrangements\\ncrazy mob of white men perpetrated another\\noutrage on the Negroes.\\n\"There can be no extenuating cireum\\nstances for lynching. The fact that a major\\ncrime had been committed is not a license\\nfor embracing lynch law, hut rather is a re\\nflection upon the lynchers, illiterate, ignor\\nant, prejudiced as they are in most instan\\nces. There can he no defense for any crime\\ncommitted by a Negro or white man, hut\\nthe law provides for punishment and the\\nexecution of this law is vested in authori\\nties, not in the mob. This mob spirit is still\\nconfined almost exclusively to the South,\\nwhere a population is still ignorant of the\\nfact that the only real asset it has is its\\ncomparatively cheap labor which lies in the\\nhands of its colored population.\\n\"The race problem is still confined to\\nthe South, which resents any attempts to\\nsuggest a solution. The exodus from Dixie\\nof the Negro would soon awaken the South\\nto an appreciation of the fact that it takes\\njust such labor ;is that of the Negro to\\nplant, cultivate and pick its cotton crop.\\nAny other kind of labor would make the\\nprice of cotton prohibitive, yet the South\\nis still trying to kill the goose that laid the\\ngolden egg.\\n\"The race question in the South is an eco\\nnomic one and the South would do well to\\ntry and clean some of its dirty linen in its\\nattitude toward the Negro. The great area\\nof the South is fitted for nothing except the\\nproduction of cotton, and despite evovy ef\\nfort to diversify its crops cotton is still king\\nand will remain so, although a diversifica\\ntion could become a fact but for climatic\\nand other conditions which are natural bar\\nriers which cannot be overcome.\\n\"The Negroes of the nation are giving\\nthe world a fine example of patriotism. One\\nbanner which was carried in the parade\\nhere the other day contained the motto:\\n\\'\\' \\'We never had a traitor.\\'\\n\"This is to the credit of the Negro race,\\nand encouragement should be given them.\\nThis encouragement should not be manifest\\nin lynching.\"\\nAs two little colored boys lay in a hay\\nmow preparatory to going to the land of\\nnod for the night they heard the wind\\nhowling and the rain falling outside. Now\\nit was the duty of these little fellows, who\\nunfortunately were without living parents\\nand like Topsy \"jest growing up,\" to each\\nmorning go after the cows for the milk\\nmaid. The little fellows listened to the\\nhowling wind and as they crouched down\\nmore comfortable in the warm hay they\\neach thought of the morrow and each\\nthought the other asleep. Finally one\\ngently called to the other as follows: Sam,\\nSam, you\\'ll have to go aftah de cows by\\nyo\\'self in de mornin, fur I\\'s gwine to be\\nsick.\" \"No I aint fur I\\'s sick now.\" Thus\\ndid those little fellows try to out scheme\\neach other only to find himself checkmated\\nand to end up by both going\\' after the cows\\nas usual in their scanty wearing apparel in\\na biting cold wind and rain storm the next\\nmorning.\\nAFRO AMERICAN HOTEL\\nPhone Beacon 912 1261 Main\\nRooms by Day or Week.

Let me say further that\\nI have absolutely no selfish end,\\neither by way of explaining past\\n-events or influencing future evenets\\ntouching my election. Having com\\nbatted the vote buying process, a\\nfact which I will establish if denial\\nis made, I believe it to be my duty.\\nthough it may be impolitic, to bring\\nthe matter squarely before the pub\\nlic.\\n\"The election or defeat of any can\\n\\'didate in a clean primary is perhaps\\na matter of little moment; for the\\nclean ballott will ultimately rectify\\nits mistakes. But when the selecting\\nmedium the primary, becomes cor\\nrupt and the tool of wealth, it parts\\ncdmpany with the interests of the\\nmasses and destroys the only safe\\nguard of popular government.\\n\"The candidate who buys a posi\\ntion of trust will sell it; he virtually\\nelects himself and is responsible to\\nnobody. If, as is often the case in\\nthe north, his office is procured by\\ncorporate influence, he serves corpo\\nrate interests. In any event the\\npeople\\'s interests suffer. They have\\nnothing to expect except from such\\nof their servants as are chosen by an\\nhonest ballot.\\n\"This practice .of vote buying is\\ngrowing in the state.

Heyward:\\nChester, S. C., Oct. 12, 1904.\\nGov. D. C. Heyward,\\nColumbia, S. C.\\nSir: In obedience to your request\\nI arrived at Kershaw, S. C., at noon\\non Monday, Oct, 3d, to investigate\\nthe lynching of John T. Morrison for\\nthe killing of William Floyd on the\\nSaturday previous. After conferring\\nwith the sheriff of Lancaster, Jno. P.\\nHunter, Esq., who had preceded me\\nthat morning, I conferred with az\\ninterviewed the mayor, some of the\\naldermen, the town marshal, several\\nof the citizens, the wife and son of\\nMorrison and two of Morrison\\'s\\nneighbors. From these I learned\\nthat the attitude of the entire town\\nand surrounding country was, by\\nhand or heart, \"His blood be upon\\nus and our children.\" Not one sin\\ngle man among them but deplored\\nlynching and excused this one, \"if\\none ever was excusable.\" Everyone\\nwith whom I conversed seemed to\\nlabor to impress me with the fact\\nthat this was the most orderly, quiet\\nand sober lynching, with the preach\\ners in the background, almost audibly\\nsaying \"amen.\" I did not get to see any \\'\\nof the local preachers; but several I\\nspoke to me after leaving Kershaw. <\\non the subject of this lynching and t\\nto my entire astonishment, they voic- i\\ned the sentiment \"If there was an t\\nexcusable lynching this was it.\" i\\nWhere are we going to end up-these\\nhorrible midnight murders by lynch t\\nlaw on all hands and public sentiment <\\nfast heading the way? A sense of\\nparalysis came upon me with the\\ndarkness of Monday night.\\nOn Tuesday morning I called a\\nspecial meeting of the town council.\\nEvery member with the town mar- i\\nshal, met us (Sheriff Hunter and my\\nself) in a special meeting. I explain\\ned that the governor had sent me to I\\ninvestigate the lynchi- they were\\nsworn officers, like myself; I wanted\\ntheir help, Mcrrison had been taken\\nfrom their custody; they were some\\nwhat responsible on this account; I\\nwanted them to deal with me in a\\nperfectly honest and straightforward\\nmanner; I would try to do the same\\nwith them; there was no use in my\\nwasting effort if they were in sym\\npathy with the lynching or would ob\\nstruct or refuse to help me in the in\\nvestigation. My appeal for help was\\nin the interest of law, the name of\\nthe state and our Maker.\\nAfter this I asked each and every\\none of them the following questions:\\ni. Are you in sympathy with the\\nlynching?\\n2. Will you help the state\\'s officers\\nin ferreting out and bringing to trial\\nthese lynchers, honestly?\\n3. Was this lynching done by town\\nfolks or from the surrounding coun\\ntry?\\nTo these three questions I have\\nverbatim answers on file. Two.alder\\nmen answered that they were indif\\nferent as to the lynching and would\\nnot help to ferret out the lynchers.\\nThe mayor and one alderman answer\\ned that they were not in sympathy\\nwith the lynching and would help the\\nstate officers provided it did not in\\nterfere with their business (both of\\nthese had much business). One alder\\nman had done all he could to prevent\\nthe lynching and would do nothing\\nmore. The clerk was in sympathy\\nwith the lynchers and would not help\\nto ferret it out and would cover up\\nevidence if he knew of any.\\nThe town marshal was not in sym\\npathy with the lynching did all he\\ncould to prevent it and would help\\nall he could to ferret it out: but was\\nbusy with collecting taxes.\\nAs to the third question the opin\\nion of three of those present was that\\nthe lynching was done by country\\npeople and of four that the crowd\\nthat did it was mixed; but by four\\nthat the country people predominat\\ned, because nobody could be missed\\nfrom the town after Morrison was\\ntaken from the guard house. This\\nlast is the opinion of the great ma\\njority of the townspeople to whom I\\ntalked. After interviewing the town\\nofficers. I requested the \\'town marshal\\nto go to every business place and an\\nnounce that I would remain at the\\ncouncil chamber until 5 o\\'clock p.\\nm. (taking 30 miutes for dinner) and\\nwanted to confer with anyone who\\nwould give me any assistance. I]\\nurged the marshal not to pass by a\\nsingle man, if possible. As a resulti\\nsix persons called on me, one of\\nthem a member of the jury of inquest\\non the lynching of Morrison. This\\nmember of that jury had taken a\\nhand in a lynching bee to the extent\\nof voting to hang the culprit; but this\\nwas for the usual -(?) crime. Of all\\nsix none knew anything except as\\n\"they say.\"\\nI tried to meet The State\\'s corres\\npondent, sent word to him and went\\nto his office. He was out of towvn.\\nI asked for and tried to find a friend\\nof the dead man, outside of his own\\nfamily. If there was one he would\\nnot own it. One man spoke kindly\\nof Morrison. and a man who had\\nknow him longest and best.\\nThe following are my conclusions\\nWilliam Floyd was a good, average\\ncitizen, sober and popular, and of a\\npopular and influential family. John\\nT. Morrison was cross-grained and\\nkilled two negroes (excusably or in1\\nexcusably), had been acquitted and\\nhad had trouble with several other\\npeople, drank, had no family nor in\\nluence. His killing Floyd was an I\\nawful murder and the community\\'s\\nmurder of him more awful still, in\\nthat the consience of the er mmu\\nnity- is debauched with his blood\\nwhich will not be w-iped out for half I\\ncentury. Morrison was a bad man;\\n)ut not as black as painted The jury\\n)f inquest is from the country. From\\nhe foregoing facts if the jury does\\niot take it into its head to vindicate\\nhe law by ferreting it out the state\\ns powerless. There is nothing, it\\neems to me, to be accomplished by\\nhe state\\'s officers, unless ihe jury and\\n:oroner invite them back. We can\\ntssist the county; but can\\'t take\\n:harge of it. I am trusting that after\\n:he first shock of the lynching has\\n)assed the conscience of the law\\ntbiding element of that county will\\n-evive, and something may be done\\nret to bring these parties to trial.\\nNhen I hear from you I will instruct\\n:he jury of inquest to close up its\\nwork.

       "    'In 1895, the Ocala (FL) Evening Star [LCCN: sn84027621] surfaced as a rival publication to the Ocala (FL) Banner [LCCN: sn88074815]. These two titles subsequently merged into one publication on September 1, 1943. The resulting Ocala (FL) Star-Banner [LCCN: sn78002071] has remained the daily newspaper in Marion County (FL) since that time. The Ocala Evening Star was also published from 1897 in a weekly edition, the Ocala (FL) Weekly Star [LCCN: sn84027622]. R.N. Dosh, editor of the Ocala Evening Star in the 1920s and 1930s, gave an address to the Ocala Rotary Club, recalling by-gone editors and rival publications, chiefest of whom was Col. Frank E. Harris of the Ocala Banner in the 1890s. He also remembered that the \"Star first saw the light of day in the press room of the Florida Baptist Witness ... the first editor was A.H. Harding ...\" The Florida Baptist Witness (Ocala, FL) LCCN sn95026767], which began publishing in 1884, was the weekly newspaper of the Florida Baptist Convention, an organ of the Southern Baptist Convention. A variant edition of the same title continues (ca. 2008) to publish. Ocala (FL) is the seat of Marion County (FL) government. The Freeze of 1894 dramatically changed the Ocala into which the Ocala Evening Star was born. The Freeze devastated the citrus industry in Marion County. Between 1895 and 1943, other forms of agriculture took the place of citrus while tourism in the area grew. The Silver Springs theme park, known for its crystal clear waters, would do its part like no other attraction in pre-World War II Marion County. The County remained primarily agricultural until after the war, when its character would again change dramatically.--E. Kesse, University of Florida Digital Library Center.',\n",

America\\ntakes its system of counties from\\nEngland, whose counties or shires\\nwere first marked out with the sword\\nby the petty kings who lorded over\\nthem from the time the Roman left\\nuntil therNorman came. Under Nor\\nman rule, the boundaries of English\\ncounties were fixed and have remain\\ned until this day. England has about\\nthe same area as Georgia, and fifty\\nor sixty counties, but these counties,\\nowing to the growth in population,\\nhave had many accessions to the\\ncounty government, until most of\\nthem now have more officials than an\\nAmerican state. France, with an\\narea of 210,000 square miles, was di\\nvided into provinces until the revo\\nlution, now it is divided into depart\\nI ments, each department correspond\\ning to one of our congressional dis\\ntricts, and these departments are\\noutraged and murdered every year by\\nwhite . men, a large number of whom\\nescape punishment. Why? In the\\nSouth, a woman outraged has a com\\nmunity to summarily avenge her\\neven if she is a stranger. In the\\nNorth, if she is without influential\\nrelatives, if she is a working woman\\nor girl; maybe at a distance from her\\nfriends, she is any man\\'s prey. If she\\nis disgraced or outraged the tardy\\nofficials of the law may put the crim\\ninal in prison, but the rest of the\\ncommunity will generally pass by on\\nthe other side. Several white men\\nhave been hung or electrocuted in the\\nNorth for ill treatment of women, but\\nonly because they added murder to a\\nworse crime.\\nWe criticised Mr. Wimpy\\'s theory\\nbecause it was unusual, but when you\\ncome to analyze it you will probably\\nagree with the Star that he is careless\\nin his statements and wonder why a\\npublication like the Manufacturers\\nRecord ever published an article based\\non such an ill-constructed foundation.\\nfnJ IpT Mf mil Urn\\nSteels\\nMake the Maxwell Thrifty\\nSEVERAL million dollars have been expended to provide mere ele\\ngance, more refinement, more comfort to the current Maxwells.\\nIt is in ever so many ways a superior appearing car; superior, too,\\nin action. . - .\\nBut not a single pound of weight has been added to burden the\\nwork of its great engine!\\nTherefore, despite the many processes of improvement, it doesn\\'t\\ncost a penny more to run a Maxwell than it did a year ago.\\nThe underlying principle of every Maxwell is to give economic\\ntransportation.\\nThis means light weight.\\nBut it means strong steels, as well.\\nIt is no easy trick to provide both lightness and strength in metal.\\nSuch a rare combination means high cost steels.\\nAnd you would find, if you compared a Maxwell with\" any car,\\nthat it equaled that car pound for pound in fine metals.\\nHow such steels affect your pocketbook is obvious. f\\n1.

I\\nROLPH DEFENDS\\nDeclares Citizens Aroused\\nby Fear of Growing\\nPower of Criminals.\\nBY JAMES ROLPH, JR.,\\nGovernor of California.\\nSACRAMENTO Calif., November 30.\\n—Kldnaplngs, murder, gangsterism and\\nracketeering have grown up in this\\ncountry to terrible proportions. There\\nis no security of property. There is no\\nsecurity of life. Mothers even fear to\\npermit their children long out of their\\nsight. The livid head of crime rears\\nltselt in every comer of our Nation.\\nAnd when we view the terrible fate that\\nbefell Brooke Hart, unobtrusively and\\nunsuspectingly going about his daily\\nwork, and the Lindbergh baby asleep\\nin his crib, we realize there is not one\\nof us safe from these fiends.\\nHow, we ask ourselves, has this de\\nplorable condition grown up in this, a\\nmost civilized and highly enlightened\\nChristian Nation? The answer is sim\\nple. These criminals no longer fear the\\nlaw.\\nIf they are arrested, the processes of\\npunishment are slow and cumbersome.\\nMany escape by technicalities; others\\nare subjected to punishment that Is\\nfarcically Inadequate compared with the\\nheinous atrociousness of their crimes.\\nFear Aroused Citizens.\\nThe one thing which the cowardly\\ncriminals fear is an aroused citizenry.\\nThey thrived on the laissez-faire at\\ntitude of our people during the past\\ndecade. But they have overstepped\\nthemselves. The Lindbergh kidnaping\\nstruck terror and bitter resentment to\\nthe hearts of every mother and father.\\nThey resolved then that kidnaping and\\ngangsterism ihust end.\\nTne lynching in San Jose is a mani\\nfestation of public sentifhent aroused.\\nThe murder of Brooke Hart was the\\nstraw that broke the patience of a long\\nsuffering people. The lynching was\\nsomething that had to happen sooner\\nor later. If It hadn\\'t happened in Cali\\nfornia It would have happened *ome\\nwhere else.\\nThe San Jose lynching Is the people\\'s\\nway of serving notice on criminals their\\nday is at an end. Kidnapings •will not\\nbe tolerated in California nor anywhere\\nelse, and I am quite certain there will\\nbe no more for a long, long time. The\\nSan Jose lesson long will be re\\nmembered.\\nLynchlngs are not pleasant, and as a\\nmatter of policy I do not either per\\nsonally or officially condone them. But\\ncrime is an infection in our national\\nsystem. Medicine Is never pleasant to\\ntake, but if it effects a cure it is always\\nworth the momentary unpleasantness.\\nNo price is too high to pay if we can\\ndrive these fiendish kidnapers out of our\\nState and Nation. Naturally, we revolt\\nat the thought of lynching contrary to\\nlaw. But that is softened when we con\\nsider the agony to which Brooke Hart.\\na fine sample of American manhood,\\nwas subjected. And when we think of\\nthe innocent Lindbergh baby wrested\\nfrom the security of his very bed and\\nCHl\\'KCH ANNOUNCEMENT.\\nHmurraal Draign\\nj murdered, can we blame the people tor\\nbecoming aroused?\\nEscape Most Be Closed.\\nNo longer can we permit these crimi\\nnals to stand back and smirk. No\\nlonger can we permit them to say, “If\\nthey do catch me I’ll get out of it.\"\\nAn aroused people will put a definite\\nand permanent end to such blatant dis\\nregard for law as we have witnessed In\\nthis far too long.\\nThe San Jose lynchings were un\\navoidable. Had I called out troops to\\nbeat down the crowd, terrible conse\\nquences would have resulted. Should\\ngood citizens be shot down to protect\\na couple of fiends for whom there are\\nno words adequate to describe? No\\ntroops were called to protect Brooke\\nHart from Thurmond and Holmes. He\\nwas given no chance to plead his case.\\nThe philosophy which causes kid\\nnapers to cringe Is that those who live\\nby the sword, and those who live by ,\\nforce and violence, must expect to ]\\nj take their chances of dying the same\\nway.\\nIt is ridiculous to say that my attl- :\\nj tude toward the California lynchings\\nhas inspired the lynching in Missouri. !\\nThe cases are not at all parallel. The I\\nSan Jose lynching was a revolt against\\nthe wave of kidnapings. It was public\\n1 display of determination to regain\\nI security of their homes, their property,\\ntheir lives. The first thought of a\\nmother Is to protect her children, and\\nthe mothers of America are going to\\nprotect their young and I am going to\\nprotect them In doing so.\\nJustifies Mooney Stand.\\nMany have attempted to bring up the\\nMooney case in condemning my state\\nj ments. Let me say to them that there\\ni have\\' been no bombings in California\\nsince Mooney was put in the peniten\\ntiary and no dynamiting since the Mc\\nNamaras were speedily Imprisoned.\\nPublic sentiment will remain aroused\\nuntil this crime wave is put down. And\\nif this is the only way that kidnapings.\\nmurders and gangsterism can be\\nstopped, public sentiment should remain\\naroused until it is.\\ni It is indeed a sleeping nation that\\ni forever will tolerate what America has\\ni tolerated from these fiends for a decade.\\nThe problem is very real in California.\\nThere are 27 kidnapers now In San\\nQuentin and two in Folsom. Back of\\nevery one is a story of terror and heart\\naches of parents.\\nToday all California, except the\\ni criminals themselves, fell safter. There\\nI is a greater security of home and family.\\n: Let us hope there la no more occasion j\\ni for lynching in this country, and if ;\\ni there are no more occasions for lynch\\ni ing, there will be no lynchings.\\nThe first duty of government is to !\\n, protect its law-abiding citizens—no mat- [\\nter what the methods or the cost. The\\n! criminals have armed themselves. They\\nhave made it war. and so have we\\ni The answer to the question of\\nwhether it was right or wrong can be\\nfound by each one asking himself: \"How\\nwould I feel if my own son were done\\nto death and demand for ransom made\\n1 upon me after he had been fiendishly\\nmurdered?”\\n(Copyright, lor*,r>.. h- \"Vorth American New*\\noaper Alliance.

Cope\\ntend, of New York, move-i to attach\\nft as an amendment to the length-\\n#f~freight—train\\nbill. It is believed\\nIhat Senator Oopeland had two\\'\\nHiotives for this entirely unexpected\\nthove.

This\\nbrought on a conference toetw\\'een\\nSenators Wagner, Copeland and Van\\nJ\\'Nuys\\nWednesday noon and it was de\\n«ided then not to use the rider meth\\npd except as a very last resort.\\nIt was felt that the anti-lynching\\n^ill ought to go through and be test\\ned on its merits and not be forced\\nthrough by the \"slick\" method of\\nattaching it as an rmendment. It\\nwas felt that he co/nty is entitled\\nt0 a record vote on this legislation.\\nIn an exchange of remarks in the\\n^Senate July 28, Senator Robert F.\\n.Wagner of New York requested per\\nmission from Majority Leader Bark\\nley to make a motion to bring up\\nfthe anti-lynching bill and it was\\ngranted. Both Senator Wagner and\\nSenator Copeland stated they wished\\nthe anti—lynching bill to be consider\\ned on its merits and they were joined\\nin this sentiment by Senator Barkley\\nwho said:\\n\"I realize the anti-lynching bill is\\na matter of importance and ought to\\nbe disposed of ...

It is, under our form of\\ngovernment, the legal and moral right of every state to\\npunish its own criminals. Federal interference with\\nthis right would be risky, and should be unnecessary.\\nA Federal law against lynching. Federal interference\\nin the capture and prosecution of persons accused of\\nlynching, would be bad for us in more than one way.\\nIt would be bad because it would lead the national gov\\nernment into the exercise of police powers yet re\\nserved to the states, because it would take away from\\nthe state and the local community the right to ad\\nminuter their own affairs, ai d because it would almost\\ncertainly lead to a weakening of the hber of local law\\nand to a loss of self -confidence and self-reliance on the\\npart of the communities affected by its application.\\nThere remains, however, a higher, more sacred\\nright than the right of the state to the exclusive ex\\nercise of the police powers within its bounds. That is\\nthe right of the individual citizen to have the benefit\\nof the guaranties and the protection the law is sup\\nposed to give him. If the state fails to protect its\\ncitizens in their constitutional rights, the nation must\\nr or later take that protection upon itself. I\\nwrite as a southern r. from a southern viewpoint, and\\nwith the southerner\\'s traditional and I think justi\\nfiable desire to see each state left as nearly free is\\nprudence permits to deal with its own particular prob\\nlems. It is as a southerner that I say that lynchings.\\nand such race r !- a- .:--w directly out of lynchincs.\\nor attempted lynchings, are not going to be tolerated\\nmuch longer by the conscience of this country or of the\\nworld, and that if the states do not stop lynchings the\\nnat n will and should do it.\\nI he mob spirit is the enemy of all law No state\\nthat permits mobs to work their will unchecked and\\nthen to go unpunished can reasonably expect obedience\\nto law or respect for tin agencies of the law. The\\nSouth has been criminally negligent in this respect, and\\nhas paid the penalty, not only in unnecessary feeling\\nand friction between the two races, but in its exces\\nsively large number of crimes against property and\\nperson. The Tulsa race riots were directly due to the\\nfailure of officials and citizens vigorously to uphold\\nthe law The recent tarring and feathering of white\\nwomen in Texas is but an example of the lengths to\\nwhich the mob spirit will go when mob crimes are\\nleft unpunished.\\nMob violence is not confined to the Smith, nor are\\nall lynchings due to race feeling White men are\\nlynched. The mob spirit, even the unreasoning race\\nKcling that leads to mob violence and lynching, exists\\nin the North as well as in the South. No section of\\nthe country can claim immunity from race prejudice\\nor from an active disrespect for the law. It is in the\\nSouth, however, where the two races are the most\\nclosely thrown together, where the race consciousness\\nis most exaggerated, and where lynchers seem to be\\nmost immune from punishment, that the worst record\\nis made.\\nLast year 61 persons were killed by mobs in the\\nUnited States. Fifty-two of these lynchings took place\\nin the South. Fifty-three of the persons lynched were\\nNegroes. Ten of the lynchings took place in Texas;\\nnine in Georgia. Several attempts at lynching were\\nBy E. E. MILLER\\nput down by officers of the law. Not a single person\\nin a southern state, so far as I have been able to learn,\\nhas been punished for taking part in a lynching. In\\na majority of cases no real effort was made to find out\\nthe guilty parties and punish them.\\nLynchings can be prevented not every lynching,\\nperhaps, but certainly a great majority of them. Most\\nof them take place simply because the officials charged\\nwith the enforcement of the law do not try to prevent\\nthem. In Tennessee, with a governor who held that\\nhe could do nothing in case of a threatened lynching\\nuntil requested by the local authorities, at least two\\nmobs pursued Negroes for two or three days before\\ncatching them, the newspapers telling day by day of\\nwhat was going on, and finally reporting the burning\\nof both victims by mobs maddened by hate and hist\\nfor blood. I saw one of these mobs with its victim;\\nrode on the same train with it for several miles and\\nknew that a dozen resolute men backed by the author\\nity of the state could have prevented the brutal and\\nbrutalizing end. The succeeding governor announced\\nthat he would use all his power to prevent lynchings,\\nand did use force against mobs. There was not a sin\\ngle lynching during his two years in office. A few\\nyears ago a white person accused of a sensational crime\\nwas taken from the Georgia penitentiary and hanged\\nby a mob. The very next morning the governor of\\nthe state came out w ith a statement that he had no idea\\nthat the guilty parties would ever be found. Newspa\\npers all over the South published detailed reports of\\nthe affair purporting to come from members of\\nthe mob. but no effort was made to find out who\\nthey were, or to bring them to justice. Since then\\nGeorgia has had more lynchings than any other state.\\nLynchings can be prevented. They occur, in most\\npart, simply because state and local officials do not try\\nto prevent them, because public sentiment to a certain\\nextent condones them.\\nThe people of the Sooth have it in their power to\\nprevent the enactment of a Federal anti-lynching law.\\nThey have it in their power to remove from the repu\\ntation of the Sooth the stain mob violence and public\\nindifference to the Negro\\'s legal rights have made\\nupon it. They have it in their power to lessen to a\\ngreat degree the present intense bitterness between the\\nrace- and to make possible a rational co-operation of\\nwhite and bfo k in the upbuilding of their common\\ncountry Hut before they can do this they must frankly\\nface the facts as they are. They must cease trying\\nto exculpate themselves and to shift all blame for the\\npresent unhappy state of things on the Negro. They\\nmust be honest with themselves, as some of them have\\nnot been. They must cease to listen to leaders who\\nwill not face the fact, or who try to appeal to prejudice\\nrather than to justice.\\nThe day after President Harding read his message,\\nSenator Heflin. of Alabama, said in almost so many\\nwrds that there is but one way to stop lynching! and\\nthat is to stop the crime that causes them. \"The\\ncrime\" implied, of course, is the assault of white\\nwomen by Negroes Of the 53 Negroei lynched last\\nyear, crimes against women were charged against 21.\\nIt is the too general southern tendency to let itself be\\nfooled by sophistries and insincerities, rather than any\\ngeneral desire to deal unfairly with the black man. that\\nhas made the South\\'s record of lynchings a thing of\\npersonal shame to every manly and patriotic southerner.\\nIt will be well for the country if lynching can be\\nstopped without a Federal anti-lynching law. They\\nshould be so stopped, and can be The time is at\\nhand, however, when lynchings are going to be stopped.\\nIf the states do not stop them the nation will.\\nMis-Picturing Us Abroad\\nenness.

Outside Holmes County—2.50.\\nAnti-Lynching Bill\\nFor a comprehensive discussion of the merits, or lack of\\nmerit, of a Federal anti-lynching bill, we call your attention to an\\neditorial which appeared in the March 2nd edition of the Wash\\nington Post:\\nAnti-Lynching Bill\\nFifty years ago lynching was a grave problem in the\\nUnited States. All during the 1890’s mob murders were a\\nbout as common as gang slayings became in the 1930’s. In the\\nsingle years of 1892 a total of 255 persons met death at the\\nhands of murderers conspiring among themselves to take\\nlaw into their own hands. One hundred of the victims were\\nwhite men. Lynching has been by no means confined to the\\ncolored race. Indeed, it was the customary method of inflict\\ning punishment on horse thieves and cattle rustlers in the\\nearly days of the west. Since the 1920’s, however, the num\\nber of white men lynched has been negligible, and last year\\nthe Tuskegee Institute recorded only one lynching of a Negro\\nIt is a sorry anachronism that just as the Southern\\nStates have almost completed the job of wiping out this dis\\ngusting crime Congress should be considering a bill to make\\nthe prevention of lynching a Federal responsibility. Half a\\ncentury ago the tlse of Federal power against lynchers might\\nhave been justified by the tragic failure of the States to pro\\ntect their citizens. Now most of the States have completely\\nmastered the problem without any help from Washington,\\nand we doubt that the Case antilynching bill would add in\\nany way to the safety of citizen.\\nThis measure, which is about to be pushed througn\\nthe House of Representatives would transfer to the Federal\\ncourts the prosecution of lynchers and of local officials fail\\ning to protect prisoners or to move against mobs after a lyn\\nching has occurred. But trials would still be held before local\\njuries, and it is probable that resentment against Federal in\\ntervention would complicate instead of easing the problem of\\nsecuring convicitions of accused mobsters. To be sure, there is\\nanother provision in the Case bill making every county, town,\\nand other governmental subdivision responsible for any lyn\\nching in its jurisdiction. But this resort to the despicable doc\\ntrine of mass guilt because of the area in which one happens\\nto live is so repugnant to democratic principles as to make\\nthe bill unpalatable to thousands who are devoted to civil\\nrights in the North as well as the South.\\nWe cannot help thinking that this vote-catching ven\\nture has no place in the present session of Congress. Its ef\\nfects is to arouse animosities at a time when there is urgent\\nneed for national unity. The lynching menace has already\\nbeen put down, and we trust that the last vestige of it will\\nsoon disappear. Our problem today is the rise of a tyranny\\nthat seeks to destroy all civil rights, whether protected by\\nState or Federal law. In the face of that menace wTe need to\\nbe mobilizing our strength - not to be opening old sores or\\nfrittering away energies on problems that have already been\\nsolved.\\nThe day of lynching is virtually a thing of the past as our\\nrecords show. We certainly hope so.\\nWe do not believe lynching is condoned by any God-fear\\ning, respectable, intelligent citizen of the south. That we can solve\\nour problems, though lynching in days past was not confined to\\nthe south by any means, is shown by tin* proven record. It is a pity\\nthat the power-crazed politicians of the north and east cannot let\\nus alone to solve our other problems peculiar to the south, or any\\nsection where two races live side by side in nearly equal numbers.\\nSen. James O. Eastland this week touched off a bombshell\\nin the senate when he proposed that the anti-lynching bill be\\nbroadened to cover murder in New York, gang wars in Chicago,\\nrace riots in Detroit and strike violence all over the country. j\\nben. Eastland s amendment, as we understood it, would\\ncall for inflicting the same penalties for the crimes mentioned as\\nfor lynching.\\nThis is bringing the Chickens home to roost in the most\\nclear-cut manner possible.\\nIf the Federal government should be called in to police lyn\\ncfaea which there was only one in the entire U. S.‘ in\\n1946) then certainly it should be called in to bring to conviction\\nthe parties guilty in the race riot in which 35 persons were killed\\nin Detroit and in other race riots in the large cities.\\nio/io M°r(i persons were killed in that one race riot in Detroit in\\n1J43 than have been lynched in the entire United States in the\\npast twenty years.\\nThe amendments offered by Sen. Eastland would (1) make\\nany state officer who neglected or refused to make diligent efforts\\nto solve any felony liable to the same punishment as that pro\\nvided for lynchers, (2) include unlawful violence of gangsters or\\nracketeers which results in murder or other felony, (3) allow\\nsuit for damages by heirs of a man killed and injured in a race\\nnot as well as in a lynching.\\nvent,,v?aH!l?\"d/iteduCaSeS in New York City where police do not\\nventure, decried such careers as A1 Capone and reviewed race\\n‘‘protection” °th-it(^G1?ian^ed that these areas be given the same\\nprotection that is being bestowed on the south.\\nSen.

You need but read again the\\nrecord of Paul’s ministry in that\\nimportant city of Ephesus to be\\nreminded of how greatly he had *\\nserved them in the name of Jesus.\\nLoved and honored! What a trib I\\nute to the worth of Christian char\\nHcit-ri woman x you appreciaie xne \\'\\ntribute which they paid Paul as the\\ngoal out yonder to which you strive?\\nBoys and girls of today may thus be\\nhonored tomorrow, if they will live\\nfor Jesus as Paul did.\\n• • •\\nTHE POWER OF RIGHT LIVING\\nDAUL not only told the Ephesians\\n1 how to live, but illustrated day\\nby day in his own life what he\\npreached to them. The most elo\\nquent sermons are not spoken, bul\\nlived. “What you are speaks so loud\\nly I can\\'t hear what you say.”\\nThe boy ar d man who plays the\\ngame straight are putting into\\npractice what 1 tlie teacher and\\npreacher proclaims on Sunday.\\nThe power of right living will win\\nits way today, just as it did in the ,\\nlong ago when Paul witnessed for\\nJesus in Ephesus.\\nIt was not easy to live for Christ!\\nin Ephesus, nor is it easy to live for\\nhim in Chicago or Los Angeles or\\nBoston or Miami, but it is the one\\nway to ultimately impress the world\\nof the reality of Christianity.\\n• • •\\nPAUL’S CONSUMING PASSION\\n\\\\Af E ARE what we are becoming,\\n’ ’ and never was this axiom oi\\nlife more powerfully illustrated than\\nin the case of Paul. \"I press on\\ntoward the goal for the prize of the\\nupward call of God in Christ Jesus,’’\\nPhilippians 3:14. And in Ephesians\\n5:0-21, Paul reviews the qualities ol\\nconduct which produce worthwhile\\ncharacter, admonishing all Chris\\ntians to strive for these qualities.\\n“I live, yet not I, Christ liveth\\nin me,” is another of Paul’s\\nwatchwords, and still again, “I\\ncan do all things through Christ, <\\nwho strengtheneth n»e.*’\\nIt was the consuming passion o!\\nhis life to embody the teachings of\\nChrist in his words and in his works.\\nIt is conceivable that the people at\\nEphesus had come to see Christ in\\nthe life of Paul, and that his daily\\nministry in their midst convinced\\nthem that God was in Christ recon\\nciling the world unto himself.\\n• * •\\nWHAT AM 1 WORTH?\\n\\'T\\'HE question then emerges,\\nA What am I worth to my com\\nmunity? When I come to the end of\\nthe journey, will the people who\\nknow me best honor and love me for\\nwhat I have done?\\nI can see the people of Ephesus\\nbowing on the dock at Miletus,\\nkissing this weary old servant of\\nthe Lord. It is a beautiful scene.\\nThis tribute meant more to Panl\\nthan all the gold of Ephesus would\\nhave meant. It was compensation\\nof abiding worth to him.

Wright,\\nspecialist in skull fractures, in\\nsisted the man was in too critical\\na condition, and in the process of\\nmoving, might suffer a hemor\\nrhage and die. An old fashioned\\n“spat” is said to have been staged\\nbetween the doctors and Perry,\\nthe pawn, is said to have sided\\nwith the white folks because they\\neducated him.\\nIt was claimed that Perry's\\nprivate doctor could not draw pay\\nfor visiting the patient at Harlem\\nhospital, and that was the main\\nreason why he wanted the “lazy\\nmovie man” removed. On the\\nother hand, it was claimed by\\nHarlem doctors that the white\\ndoctor showed that he was more\\ninterested in the patient’s money\\nthan in his life ,for insisting on\\nmoving him within two days of\\nthe serious accident. Perry is\\nsaid to have told his white doctor\\nthat he was receiving excellent\\ncare at Harlem , but also due to\\nthe bad reputation of Harlem, it\\nis believed that many white film\\nexecutives didn’t like the idea of\\ntheir star being there. Dr. Wright\\nis said to have carried his protest\\nto Mayor LaGuardia himself, but\\nthe Mayor pushed responsibility\\noff on the white superintendent of\\nHarlem, who in turn allowed Perry\\nto be moved. Dr. Wright ordered\\ncolored Harlem hospital doctors to\\nrefuse to sign out the patient, and\\nINSURANCE COMPANIES\\nMAKE BIG STRIDES\\n“ RICHMOND, Va.

The patient was re\\nmoved on the persona] responsi\\nbility of his own doctor.\\nAnother odd angle was that the\\nGotham hospital, to which Perry\\nwas removed, had to call up Dr.\\nWright as an authority on the\\nsubject and ask for his method\\nof treating skull fractures. It is\\nsaid Dr. Wright sent about twelve\\npages of manuscript to the hos\\npital. Harlem’s comment was that\\nit was odd, indeed, that although\\nHarlem hospital was apparently\\nnot good enough for Perry, the\\nexclusive white hospital to which\\nhe went had to ask the colored\\ndoctor at Harlem how to treat the\\npatient.\\nAnother angle to the case was\\nthe report that while Perry’s white\\ndoctor was arguing to move him,\\nhe forgot to make “special” reser\\nvations for him at the exclusive\\n“white” hospital, and when he ar\\nrived, the report was given that\\n“no bed” was available, similar to\\nthe report given the late Mrs.\\nW.

Bryant\\nWashington, Nov. 18,—South\\nern Congressmen are not happy\\nover the outlook lor legislation\\nhere; they see trouble ih several\\nimportant bills, and would pre\\nfer not to record their votes on\\nthem. The wage-and-hour, the\\nfarm, and the anti-lynching\\nmeasures worry them. Saw\\nmill owners and operators, cot\\nton ginners, and others are pro\\ntesting against the labor bill.\\nThey assert it will put them out\\nof business and result in a de :\\ncided advantage if not a monop\\noly to big operators. Cotton\\nfarmers are in doubt as to the\\nvalue of the proposed farm leg\\nislation.\\nThe anti-lynching bill, aimed\\ndirectly at the South, is rank\\npoison to many members of the\\nHouse and a coterie of Senators.\\nIt passed the House by an over\\nwhelming vote and has the prom\\nise of at least 70 out of the 96\\nmembers of the Senate. The op\\nposition of the Southern Con\\ngressmen does not mean that\\nthey favor lynching but that\\nthey dislike being singled out\\nfor punishment when a week sel\\ndom passes in cities like New\\nYork, Chicago, Cleveland, De\\ntroit and San Francisco that\\ngangsters, criminal mobs, do not\\ntake men and women for one\\nway rides.\\nLed by Senator William E.\\nBorah of Idaho, a large number\\nof lawyers in Congress hold that\\nthe anti-lynching Bill now pend\\ning in the Senate is contrary to\\nthe provisions of the Constitu\\ntion, but that is not going to\\ndefeat the bill. The only hope\\nfor those w r ho would stop the\\nlegislation is in a prolonged fili-*\\nbuster, and such a strenuous and\\nquestionable effort is not on the\\nprogram. Were it the closing\\ndays instead of the beginning of\\na session, attempts to talk the\\nGavagan bill to death might be\\nmade, and succeed.\\nThe Senate has agreed to con\\nsider* the measure. Such an\\nagreement was entered into at\\nThe last session when it appeared\\nthat other legislation would be\\ndelayed if not discarded if the\\nanti-lynching bill remained in a\\nstrategic position in the Senate.\\nNow, with the.new session un\\nder way, a vote is imminent. The\\nbill was reported favorably by\\nthe Senate judiciary committee\\nby a three-to-one vote. v\\nIt would not be hard for any one\\nfamiliar with Congress and pol\\nitics to list the Senators who will\\nsupport the Gavagan bill as pre\\nsented to the Senate at the last\\nsession.
